By          Tricia Wang           Tricia Wang           BuzzFeed Contributor             Twitter          Tweet             Facebook          Share             Copy          Copy                   Yifan Wu for BuzzFeed News          The journalists at BuzzFeed News are proud to bring you trustworthy and relevant reporting about the coronavirus. To help keep this news free,           become a member          and sign up for our newsletter,           Outbreak Today          .         Years ago, I walked the bustling streets of Wuhan as a Chinese American doing fieldwork on technology use among vulnerable populations. Back in January, when I started seeing footage of those streets silent and empty due to a city-wide quarantine to slow down the coronavirus outbreak, I went back into ethnographer mode. I worked with two of my former researchers, Shayla Qiu and Reginald Zhu, in Wuhan, to conduct virtual fieldwork to understand how people on the ground were responding to this crisis.         Through a series of interviews over WeChat, I discovered a very different story about Wuhan than what I was reading in Western media. While news reports here focused on the authoritarian, top-down measures the Chinese government used to slow the rate of infection \u2014 including the suppression of information and rapid construction of temporary hospitals \u2014 the story I found was one of totally invisible, yet highly sophisticated networks of localized cooperation. It wasn\u2019          t just         top-down measures that successfully slowed the infections in Wuhan, it was also bottom-up, dynamic organizing in emergent, hyperlocal groups.         Neighbors were using social media to find food and medicine, support the sick, and help each other survive.         And as coronavirus spreads across the United States and the world, we need to follow suit. We need to connect with people who live near us, centralize communication, and pool resources so we can care for one another.          In a crisis where our own government\u2019s response has felt uneven and at times misleading         , we must learn from Wuhan and create our own hyperlocal support groups to come out stronger together.         When Wuhan residents recognized that quarantine would be lengthy and government resources would be stretched, they turned to each other for help. They utilized an existing social construct, the          xiao qu         (\u5c0f\u533a) group, which literally translates to \u201csmall district.\u201d A          xiao qu         is an official designation from the city grouping together all the homes in a given area. Typically, a          xiao qu         captain (a volunteer or someone appointed by the property management) invites all residents into one WeChat group, which can range from 50 to 500 people in size. Wuhan has at least 7,106          xiao qu         groups among its 11.08 million residents, many of which existed before the coronavirus took hold.         Once quarantines started, people realized that they could use the          xiao qu         to communicate with their socially distanced neighbors. And the hyperlocal network was born.         They shared information. Whenever a news report circulated on WeChat, the group would examine and vet it together, pointing to better, verified sources. When rumors about potential cures were shared, people would warn each other from trying them.         They shared uplifting quotes, memes, home exercise regimes, and recipes, but also asked their neighbors to go out and buy food or pick up medicine for them, a way of limiting group exposure. When an elderly woman without a smartphone told her neighbor that she had run out of food, the neighbor posted to the          xiao qu         group and her people donated portions of their groceries. When people fell ill, members fanned out into other WeChat groups to help find hospital beds and get information on caring for someone with the virus.                   via WeChat            One widely shared Chinese meme, on the social pressure online to wear a mask: \"At night: 'when you go outdoors, wear a mask.' At noon: 'when you go outdoors, wear a mask.' In the morning: 'when you go outdoors, wear a mask.'\u201d         Eventually          xiao qu         groups and businesses worked together to coordinate group purchasing. When it wasn\u2019t feasible for grocery stores to make deliveries to individuals, members of the          xiao qu         s pooled their orders for a single transaction with supermarkets. Sign-up sheets were made for bulk ordering of eggs, milk, and cleaning supplies. Soon the practice spread to bakeries, restaurants, and, most importantly, pharmacies.         The          xiao qu         groups made people feel less lonely and more connected during a time of extended isolation. So while we may not have an exact cousin of the          xiao qu         outside of China, we can still create similar groups to help us weather the coronavirus storm.         When New York City began instituting social distancing and staying at home, I set up my own neighborhood          xiao qu.         I borrowed what I\u2019d learned from my researchers in Wuhan, and connected nearby friends and neighbors within walking distance on WhatsApp where we vetted information, shared updates on local store inventory, and checked in on those who felt ill. I\u2019ve incorporated practices that work well in the online communities I use for work, including asking participants to agree to a code of conduct, maintaining a directory of all participants, and organizing the most frequently asked questions into a shared Google Doc.         Our group includes families, people who live alone, and people with immunocompromised systems. We have discussed topics ranging from which local stores have hand sanitizers to interesting activities to do with one\u2019s kids. We have solved problems such as how to determine if a mask manufacturer is credible or not, how to safely send laundry to the laundromat, and which local organizations need help. People have asked the group what they should do if they feel sick. When levity is needed, members have organized virtual dance parties like          tfw.nyc         or told others which webcams show the cutest baby animals.         In the short time that our local network has been up, it has inspired a few other groups in Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. All of us manage our groups a little differently, but the Wuhan template remains the same: a small group of neighbors supporting one another during a time when movement is restricted, and knowledge of one\u2019s immediate area is crucial.         Having lived through SARS and contracted H1N1, I know from personal experience that hyperlocal contacts can mean the difference between life and death. When you\u2019re sick and scared during a quarantine, it could likely be your neighbor, not your sister who lives three states away or overwhelmed health practitioners at hospitals who could help you in that moment. Many of us keep in touch with friends and colleagues across the globe but have never really gotten to know the people on our street or in our building. That needs to change, and fast.         Federal and state responses to coronavirus are becoming more organized, but the magnitude of this crisis requires massively sustained bottom-up efforts too. This is why          mutual-aid networks          caremongering,          local delivery for at-risk populations         , and          neighborhood slack groups         are being activated like wildfire across the US.         We participate in tons of social networks as lurkers, broadcasters, or participants \u2013 tiny drops in a sea of anonymity. But right now, following isn't enough. Hyperlocal groups create an opportunity to find commonality with those who live within walking distance, the people who most need your help and who are in the best position to help you. During uncertain times like these, we don\u2019t just need to look to scientists, governments, and industry for leadership, we also need to look to each other.           If you\u2019re ready to start your own hyperlocal community network, here are step-by-step            instructions           with a link to a template and best practices.

It was April 2018, the peak of the Cambridge Analytica             scandal            , and Mark Zuckerberg was testifying before an angry Congress. Republican senator Orrin Hatch, then 84 years old, asked how Facebook could make any money by offering a free service. \u201cSenator, we run ads,\u201d Zuckerberg replied, breaking into a smirk. The exchange went viral as a testament to congressional ignorance\u2014can you believe this old guy             doesn\u2019t know how Facebook works            ?            In fact,             Hatch did know            . Senators, like lawyers, often ask questions to which they already have the answer. But the moment was deeply revealing for another reason. In the nearly two years since that hearing, policy makers have been trying to figure out what to do about Facebook and other social media giants. They have             argued            over whether to revoke platforms\u2019 Section 230 immunity, launched a barrage of antitrust investigations, and introduced a number of competing privacy bills into the Senate. Above all, they\u2019ve tried to browbeat the companies into adopting better policies around things like fact-checking, content moderation, and political ads.            What they haven\u2019t done is question social media\u2019s underlying business model.            Jump ahead to another hearing, this past January. Another old Republican member of Congress, Ken Buck, was questioning another young tech executive, Basecamp cofounder David Heinemeier Hansson. \u201cI don\u2019t really care if they tell fifteen tee-shirt companies that I\u2019m out looking for a tee-shirt,\u201d Buck said. \u201cIt\u2019s another thing when you\u2019re trying to use that information in ways that I explicitly don\u2019t want that information used. And so, what\u2019s the answer there?\u201d This was nothing new: a lawmaker in Washington who took for granted that our online behavior will be shared with advertisers, only then to wonder how one might contain the damage that ensues. But this time, his tech-world witness would reject the premise.            The solution to our privacy problems, suggested Hansson, was actually quite simple. If companies couldn\u2019t use our data to target ads, they would have no reason to gobble it up in the first place, and no opportunity to do mischief with it later.  From that fact flowed a straightforward fix: \u201cBan the right of companies to use personal data for advertising targeting.\u201d            If Hansson\u2019s proffer\u2014that targeted advertising is at the heart of everything wrong with the internet and should be outlawed\u2014sounds radical, that\u2019s because it is. It cuts to the core of how some of the most profitable companies in the world make their money. The journalist David Dayen argued             a similar case            in 2018, for the             New Republic            ; and since then, the idea has quietly been gaining adherents. Now it\u2019s taken hold in certain parts of academia, think-tank world, and Silicon Valley.            The thinking goes like this. Google and Facebook, including their subsidiaries like Instagram and YouTube, make about             83 percent            and             99 percent            of their respective revenue from one thing: selling ads. It\u2019s the same story with Twitter and other free sites and apps. More to the point, these companies are in the business of what\u2019s called             behavioral             advertising            , which allows companies to aim their marketing based on everything from users\u2019 sexual orientations to their moods and menstrual cycles, as revealed by everything they do on their devices and every place they take them. It follows that most of the unsavory things the platforms do\u2014boost inflammatory content, track our whereabouts, enable election manipulation, crush the news industry\u2014stem from the goal of boosting ad revenues. Instead of trying to clean up all these messes one by one, the logic goes, why not just remove the underlying financial incentive? Targeting ads based on individual user data didn\u2019t even really exist until the past decade. (Indeed, Google still makes many billions of dollars from ads tied to search terms, which aren\u2019t user-specific.) What if companies simply weren\u2019t allowed to do it anymore?            Advertisement            \u201cTo me, banning targeted ads is the ultimate root-cause solution when it comes to privacy,\u201d Hansson told me. Seemingly every week, there\u2019s another article exposing some company\u2019s creepy behavior. A recent European study, for example,             found            that the gay dating app Grindr was sharing user data, including precise location history, with 35 different third parties.            But while each revelation is disturbing, the stories shouldn\u2019t really shock us. The behavioral advertising business model has given rise to a teeming ecosystem of adtech firms, including data brokers, that pass user information through each step of the chain between publishers and advertisers. It\u2019s all perfectly legal and very profitable, which explains why established companies like Adobe, Comcast, and Amazon have been getting in on the action. \u201cThe only reason that Facebook and others are collecting this data, buying this data\u2014             stealing            this data\u2014is because the data is so valuable,\u201d Hansson said. \u201cIf you reduce the value of that data to near zero, then the entire incentive disappears.\u201d            \u201cPrivacy\u201d is only one way of describing the issue. Other experts blame the ad-driven business model for  the proliferation of hateful and false content on social media. In a 2019 essay for the Knight First Amendment Institute, Jeff Gary and Ashkan Soltani             argued            that \u201crestricting or lessening\u201d the ability to microtarget ads would be more effective, and raise fewer free speech issues, than any law policing online discourse. The market for such ads creates incredible demand for users\u2019 attention on both the front and back ends: the more time you spend on Facebook, the more finely it can target you             and            the more ads you\u2019ll see. Combine that with the fact that users gravitate toward provocative content, and you can see where things might go. In the past, at least, sensation-seeking publications had to worry that sinking too far into the gutter would alienate their advertisers. Now the gutter is a money pit.            Then there\u2019s politics. A 2018 study by researchers at Data and Society             concluded            that \u201ctoday\u2019s digital advertising infrastructure creates disturbing new opportunities for political manipulation and other forms of antidemocratic strategic communication.\u201d Sally Hubbard, director of enforcement strategy at the Open Markets Institute, an anti-monopoly think tank, takes the argument further in a forthcoming book. \u201cI honestly believe we are not going to solve any of the problems that we\u2019re worried about, like election interference and disinformation, unless we ban targeted advertising,\u201d she told me recently. Facebook, she said, has created a \u201cmanipulation machine\u201d that can be used to discourage black voters just as easily as to sell sneakers. (Facebook didn\u2019t reply to requests for comment.) \u201cIt\u2019s the business model that\u2019s the problem.\u201d            If this nascent movement had a motto, that would be it: the business model is the problem. The task of regulating an increasingly out of control digital environment often looks like a multifront war against various enemies: privacy breaches, hate speech, disinformation, and more. What if we had a weapon that could bring all those armies to their knees?               <noscript>            Advertisement             Let\u2019s pretend it            really happened. Imagine Congress passed a law tomorrow morning that banned companies from doing any ad microtargeting whatsoever. Close your eyes and picture what life would be like if the leading business model of the internet were banished from existence. How would things be different?            Many of the changes would be subtle. You could buy a pair of shoes on Amazon without Reebok ads following you for months. Perhaps you\u2019d see some listings that you didn\u2019t see before, for jobs or real estate. That\u2019s especially likely if you\u2019re African-American, or a woman, or a member of another disadvantaged group. You might come to understand that microtargeting had supercharged advertisers\u2019 ability to discriminate, even when they weren't             trying            to.            It\u2019s true, the ads you came across while browsing might be for things you\u2019re less inclined to buy. But a ban on targeted advertising wouldn\u2019t mean the end of personalization. Spotify could still suggest Marvin Gaye based on your enjoyment of Sam Cooke. Bumble could still monitor your swipes to figure out your type. Netflix could still surmise that your life has felt empty ever since you finished season 7 of the             Great British Baking Show            , and suggest the appropriate spinoffs. (For example.) What companies couldn\u2019t do anymore is share their dossiers about you with adtech companies and advertisers. The geyser of behavioral data currently gathered for marketing purposes would slow to a trickle. As a result, a lot less of your personal information would end up in the hands of data brokers and, from there, third parties like insurance companies, potential employers, or             law enforcement agencies            .            With the market for our behavioral data mostly shut off, social media platforms and other free apps would have to come up with ways to replace lost ad revenues. A hard paywall for Facebook or Instagram would be unlikely, though\u2014social networks can\u2019t afford to kick off too many users. Instead, they might decide to add a premium option next to the existing free version. Meanwhile, if theorists like Gary and Soltani are right, your feed would slough off its most offensive, hateful content.            You\u2019d probably be able to read about all these changes in a revived news media. The past decade has been devastating for journalism, with waves of job losses year after year. The rise of behavioral advertising isn\u2019t the sole culprit, but it\u2019s a big one. Newspaper ad revenue, steadily climbing until 2006, has plunged ever since. Where have advertisers taken their budgets instead? Overwhelmingly, to Facebook and Google and the advertising infrastructure they control. Take away their targeting advantage, and marketers would have to shift back to paying publications to reach their audiences, so-called \u201ccontextual advertising.\u201d Getting rid of microtargeting wouldn\u2019t singlehandedly restore journalism to its glory days, but it could help\u2014a lot.            The proponents of a behavioral advertising ban paint a rosy picture: less discrimination, better civic discourse, a rejuvenated news media. What\u2019s not to like?               <noscript>            Advertisement             \u201cNobody likes advertising,\u201d            says John Deighton, a Harvard business professor who has studied the economic benefits of microtargeting. \u201cThey just like what they get for free as a result of it.\u201d For Deighton, the existence of the internet as we know it depends on behavioral advertising. \u201cThe simple rejoinder to anyone who doesn\u2019t like it,\u201d he says, is that any viable alternative would leave you with either less content overall, or a vast network of subscription walls.            Other defenders of the status quo go further, suggesting that we would be forlorn without the steady companionship of our \u201crelevant\u201d online ads. \u201cI think that relevant ads enhance the consumer experience,\u201d said Dave Grimaldi, executive vice president of public policy at the Interactive Advertising Bureau, the leading industry trade group. \u201cI think they help serve the right ads to the right people at the right time.\u201d            It\u2019s possible that consumers are happy to have the most minute details of their lives surveilled and monetized in return for seeing ads they might want to click on. This is a hard theory to test, because very few people even know they\u2019re making the trade. However, one organization recently tried to find out. After the European Union\u2019s landmark privacy law, the General Data Protection Regulation, went into effect in 2018, a Dutch public broadcasting agency started prompting all visitors to its website to choose, in a clear and straightforward manner, whether they wanted their data shared with advertisers. The result? Ninety percent opted out, and the agency abandoned behavioral advertising altogether. (A Google spokesperson notes that all users can opt out of personalized ads, and that Google has long prohibited personalized advertising based on sensitive information.)            Meanwhile, according to Google and others in the industry, microtargeting actually helps publishers to survive. Instead of siphoning off money, behavioral ads boost publishers\u2019 bottom lines by providing their advertisers with more expensive, higher-value opportunities. \u201cData shows personalized ads are valuable for the entire digital advertising ecosystem: users prefer relevant ads and publishers make significantly more money from personalized advertising,\u201d the company said in an emailed statement. Elsewhere, Google has             argued            that publishers would lose more than half their revenue if they stopped using the technique. Deighton has made similar findings, in a study commissioned by the Interactive Advertising Bureau.            But recent academic research suggests that the effect is actually quite modest. Professors Veronica Marotta, Vibhanshu Abhishek, and Alessandro Acquisti             compared            a major online publisher\u2019s revenue from ads served to users who had cookies enabled\u2014meaning they could be targeted\u2014against revenue from ads served to users who couldn\u2019t be targeted. (Their paper is still in draft form.) After controlling for a variety of other factors, they found that the presence of the cookie alone accounted for a 4 percent average increase in revenue, or 0.00008 cents per click. That\u2019s not nothing, but it\u2019s a lot less than what Google claims\u2014and it has to be weighed against what publishers could be making if the market weren\u2019t dominated by the Facebook-Google duopoly. And here\u2019s a piece of anecdotal evidence: in 2019, the New York Times             stopped            running behavioral ads in Europe. Revenues were unaffected.            Meanwhile, the ability to track users wherever they go tends to shift ad revenue from higher quality sites to less reputable ones. \u201cThe way the adtech system works is, it follows the reader from Wired.com all the way down to the cheapest possible place, the basement bottom-feeders on the internet, and will serve you the ads there,\u201d explained Nandini Jammi, a former product marketer and co-founder of Sleeping Giants, which pressures brands not to advertise on sites that promote hate or bigotry. Jammi pointed me to worldlifestyle.com, whose             homepage            features a random jumble of years-old articles on celebrities, self-help, and cute animals. It\u2019s a content farm: a site designed not for human eyes, but to make money by harvesting ad clicks from bots.            Advertisement            Proponents of the business model claim, finally, that behavioral targeting is good for the little guy. Mark Zuckerberg even brought this up in Facebook\u2019s most recent earnings             call            , committing himself to \u201cstanding up for giving small businesses more opportunity and sophisticated tools against those who say targeted advertising is a problem.\u201d            Many small businesses, especially direct-to-consumer, do use behavioral ads to build their customer base. David Heinemeier Hansson told me his company, Basecamp, had success with a Facebook ad campaign in 2017. \u201cCompared to everything else we did online, they were the most effective,\u201d he said. \u201cTargeted advertising works.\u201d (Hansson added that he gave up on Facebook advertising anyway because he finds it objectionable.)            And yet, if behavioral advertising were such a boon to entrepreneurship, you might expect it to have spurred a wave of startup growth. Even more than a decade since the recession, though, both the startup rate and the share of Americans working for small businesses are at historic lows\u2014in large part thanks to the             rise            of monopolistic companies like Facebook and Google, according to many experts. Microtargeting might help some small enterprises get ahead, but that doesn't mean it\u2019s a boon overall. As with any business strategy, there are both winners and losers.            Entrepreneurs aren\u2019t the only small fish who use targeting. Political candidates who rely on a high volume of small donors also benefit from being able to target their appeals to the people most likely to respond. They could have a harder time campaigning in a post-microtargeting world. On the other hand, by far the biggest spenders on digital political ads this year are a trio of billionaires\u2014Michael Bloomberg, Tom Steyer, and Donald Trump\u2014the first two of whom probably would never have even made it to a televised debate if not for their war chests. Which illustrates a fundamental truth: Digital platforms, like most technological advances in history, often end up delivering the biggest benefits to the             already            rich and powerful.               <noscript>             One afternoon in            January, I sent a Twitter DM to an Irishman named Johnny Ryan. All I knew about him was that he worked on policy issues for Brave, a privacy-focused browser; another source had suggested I reach out. Ten minutes later, we were on a video call. Ryan, an academic turned tech-worker turned privacy crusader, talked me through the inner workings of the online ad industry from his home office in Ireland, and I came to realize why his perspective is so important. In the U.S., a handful of folks are suggesting that the behavioral advertising business model should be illegal. In Europe, a coalition of activists including Ryan are saying that it already is.            Advertisement            In a series of legal complaints filed around the continent, Ryan and his colleagues argue that most digital advertising brazenly violates Europe\u2019s new privacy law. It all comes down to the \u201creal-time bidding\u201d system that connects advertisers with users. Usually, when there\u2019s an opportunity to show you an ad, tens or hundreds or thousands of companies compete in an instantaneous and automated auction for your eyeballs. The idea is to connect you with the one who puts the highest value on someone with your precise characteristics. In the course of this auction, all these companies (plus perhaps a dozen intermediaries) gain at least transient access to your personal data.            But the GDPR generally forbids companies from processing user data without consent. It\u2019s simply impossible, the activists argue, for users to consent to real-time bidding when there\u2019s no way to know which companies are involved in the auction. Ryan calls it \u201cthe largest data breach ever recorded.\u201d            The law does offer a potential loophole: Companies can process user data if it\u2019s necessary for their \u201clegitimate interests . . . except where such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject.\u201d The fate of the legal assault on real-time bidding may hinge on how European courts interpret that vague clause.

Because you will create other business models that are more privacy-friendly.\u201d            The U.S. doesn\u2019t yet have a national privacy law, let alone a substantive debate over whether we should ban all behavioral advertising. But that could change faster than you might think. Just a few years ago, for instance, hardly anyone was talking about enforcing antitrust laws against the tech giants; now that idea motivates             multiple investigations            at the state and federal levels.            Perhaps the Overton window on behavioral ads will see a similar shift. Fordham law professor Zephyr Teachout helped put anti-monopoly issues on the map in her upstart 2014 primary challenge to New York Governor Andrew Cuomo. Now she is part of the pushback against microtargeting. In early February, she co-authored a paper             arguing            that the dominant internet platforms should be treated as public utilities and prohibited from using behavioral ads. If telephone utilities aren\u2019t allowed to eavesdrop on our conversations and sell the details to marketers, then Amazon or YouTube shouldn\u2019t be able to do the same with our browsing history.            And while there\u2019s no GDPR-style legislation in the works here, some proposals would move us in that direction. In California, an initiative on this year\u2019s ballot would expand the state\u2019s new             privacy law            to give users broader rights to opt out of both the sale and sharing of their data. That\u2019s not the same as a prohibition, of course; but it does suggest that the era of behavioral advertising as a fact of life may be coming to an end. So does the fact that internet browsers have been             moving            to block third-party cookies. Members of Congress may now take it as a given that your tee-shirt shopping habits should be tracked and traded. Will they feel the same in 2022, or 2024?            Even the staunchest critics of the present system recognize that killing microtargeting wouldn\u2019t be a panacea. The internet\u2019s worst pathologies\u2014its effects on discourse, media, privacy, and so on\u2014defy any single remedy. Shoshana Zuboff, author of             The Age of Surveillance Capitalism,            cautions that the practice of mining and monetizing user data has migrated to sectors like insurance, finance, and even             automobiles            \u2014not to mention law enforcement, as the revelations about the facial recognition company             Clearview AI            remind us. And Roger McNamee, a former Zuckerberg confidant who is now a zealous big-tech             antagonist            , argues that microtargeting is only half the problem. Even a subscription-based social network would want to engage its users, he said, and what engages users is sensationalism and filter bubbles. \u201cI do not think it is enough to address the damage of microtargeting if you don\u2019t also deal with algorithmic amplification,\u201d McNamee told me.            Advertisement            Even if a ban on microtargeting were merely a cure-some, rather than a cure-all, it could still be quite powerful. Instead of negotiating baroque regulatory regimes and opt-outs, just alter the incentives. Of course, there would be some victims of this change, some businesses that would struggle to adapt. But Google could still make a fortune selling ads based on people\u2019s search terms (currently around 60 percent of its revenue) and the content of YouTube videos. Facebook would still have its massive user base.            \u201cCould all these [businesses] still exist? I think yes,\u201d said Tim Libert, a computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon and a harsh             critic            of the surveillance economy. \u201cThe thing that won\u2019t exist is this weird anomaly where some advertising companies\u2014which is what they are\u2014are the biggest, most powerful companies on the planet.\u201d            More Great WIRED Stories             The secret history of              a Cold War mastermind             How to clean your smartphone              the right way             Algae caviar, anyone?

Now, recent reports say the U.S. government is in talks with controversial surveillance and data gathering companies to enlist them in addressing the coronavirus crisis, signaling an escalation in the use of surveillance tools.            Last week the             Wall Street Journal reported            the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) enlisted Palantir, a data-analysis behemoth that works with law enforcement and other government security agencies, to model outbreak data. Palantir and             Clearview AI,            the facial recognition startup that acquired billions of facial images through public web scraping, have been in contact with state governments about tracking people who came in contact with infected individuals.              See also:               In Fight Against Coronavirus, Governments Face Trade-Offs on Privacy            The reports caused alarm among privacy advocates who, while noting the need to address the public health crisis, worry about the companies that are being pulled in to help.            \u201cDuring times of crisis, civil liberties are most at risk because the normal balance of safety versus privacy becomes tilted toward safety,\u201d says Michele Gilman, a privacy lawyer and fellow at Data &amp; Society, a think tank that studies the social impact of data-centric tech.            \u201cA major concern is that new surveillance technologies deployed during the coronavirus crises will become the \u2018new normal\u2019 and permanently embedded in everyday life after the crisis passes. This can result in ongoing mass surveillance of the population without adequate transparency, accountability or fairness,\u201d she said.            There is a precedent for this, and from not long ago. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 led to an expansion of surveillance cameras and networks across the U.S. and             the Patriot Act            , a federal law that removed legislative guardrails to government surveillance and decreased transparency, accelerating the National Security Agency\u2019s intrusive and massive surveillance capabilities later             revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden            . Despite the public backlash against the NSA\u2019s practices, lawmakers have             yet to de-authorize it.             \u201cAmbiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use... rip away control and transparency for people.\u201d            \u201cMany of the directives implemented as part of the Patriot Act led to the abuses that were exposed by Snowden,\u201d says Steven Waterhouse, the CEO and co-founder of Orchid Labs, a privacy focused VPN company. \u201cWhat abuses will we learn about later, after this crisis has passed? What legislation will be rammed through the government during this time of crisis?\u201d            Things that may now be considered mundane, such as an abundance of surveillance cameras, being subjected to full body screens at the airport and the idea that we are constantly being observed, weren\u2019t always the case. Often, public crises provide opportunities for surveillance architecture to move forward and become normalized fixtures of society. and create commercial opportunities for tech companies to provide new and ever more intrusive ways of tracking individuals.            That\u2019s the case with Clearview AI, a facial recognition startup that claims to have scraped billions of public images off the web and created software that can identify a face within seconds. It markets itself to law enforcement within the U.S. but also targeted authoritarian regimes around the world with records of human rights abuses as part of a rapid expansion plan,             according to documents obtained by Buzzfeed News            . The company has also             overstated the effectiveness of its technology            , claiming police departments solved cases after using it when that was not the case. The company now faces             legal challenges            from other companies, and state governments.            \u201cClearview has a\u00a0 pretty consistent pattern of not being forthcoming about information but also intentionally misleading their clients in my view,\u201d says Clare Garvie, senior associate at the Georgetown University Law Center's Center on Privacy and Technology. \u201cWhatever means the government implements or various state and local governments implement to combat the spread of this virus must be the least intrusive means possible. What Clearview AI is proposing is not the least intrusive means possible.\u201d            Extensive research shows facial recognition is not equally accurate on everyone.              See also:               Mass Surveillance Threatens Personal Privacy Amid Coronavirus            \u201cFacial recognition is notoriously inaccurate for women and people of color,\u201d says Gilman. \u201cGiven this, why would we adopt such technologies to battle coronavirus? Moreover, we need much more information on how these technologies are effective in battling a global pandemic.\u201d            China has facial recognition systems that detect elevated temperature, while South Korea has tracked people using cell phone data and             locations of financial transactions.            Palantir, meanwhile, has extensive contracts with law enforcement and has little to no transparency about its practices unless you\u2019re a customer. In a             rare user manual for law enforcement obtained by Vice            in 2019, the program Palantir Gotham is said to be in use at law enforcement centers that target data sources including day care centers, email providers and traffic accidents for data that builds profiles of suspects, and their friends, family and business associates.            The company was co-founded by Peter Thiel, the liberatarian billionaire who was also an early investor in Facebook. Privacy advocates have reason to fear his motives. In a 2009             essay for the Cato Institute            , a libertarian think tank in Washington, D.C., Thiel wrote that \u201cmost importantly, I no longer believe that freedom and democracy are compatible.\u201d             Public-Private            If privacy experts seem skeptical of companies like Clearview AI and Palantir, this is perhaps one reason why.            \u201cCreating public-private partnerships to share sensitive data in times of crisis, such as a terrorism attack or a pandemic, brings short-term benefits but has an alarming impact on data privacy long after the emergency passes,\u201d says Raullen Chai, CEO of             IoTeX            , a Silicon Valley company that develops privacy-protecting smart devices using blockchain.            \u201cAmbiguous policies around what happens to the data collected after its intended use, as well as subjective triggers of \u2018emergency-only\u2019 practices, rip away control and transparency for people.\u201d            Experts recognize the fundamental need to address immediate consequences of the coronavirus pandemic, but there is skepticism Clearview AI or Palantir would offer the required transparency and least intrusive approach.            Garvie worries about crisis profiteering. \u201cIt\u2019s the use of fear to market surveillance tools,\u201d says Garvie.\u00a0 \u201cI just caution anyone considering contracting for these tools to make sure the decision is not being driven by the supplier, by the company, using the crisis to push through unnecessary surveillance mechanisms.\u201d             Note: The description of Palantir's business has been updated.

Ongweso Jr                  ; illustrated by                  Hunter French                  Mar 19 2020, 1:00pm                    <defs>                   Share                    <defs>

driver in New York City. Each year, Tariq has watched his wages slump and his expenses climb. He\u2019s added more hours and days to what was once a 40-hour, five-day work week. Even in the worst moments, though, he never found himself sleeping in his car like some of his driver friends regularly did. Until the \u201clockout.\u201d                Over the last few years, Tariq joined two groups that represent ride-hail drivers: the New York Taxi Workers Alliance and the Independent Drivers Guild. Both labor groups promised to leverage their large memberships into direct action that would pressure City Hall into finally improving working conditions for ride-hail drivers like him. Their activism led to the introduction of a series of                 landmark regulations                from the New York City Council and Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission (TLC) in August 2018: a cap on the number of ride-hail vehicles, along with a pay floor that promised to drastically improve driver pay.                Almost immediately, ride-hail apps                 tried and failed                to challenge these regulations in court. Over the past nine months, however, they have successfully undercut these rules with a new tiered quota system for drivers. In an attempt to avoid having drivers collecting wages while being underutilized by riders, Uber and Lyft have restricted the number of drivers who can log on at any given time, with preference given to drivers who drive the most.                Ever since these changes were first introduced, Tariq has been sleeping in his car to meet the quotas. It\u2019s not that he\u2019s homeless. Because he has fallen below the top tier of drivers, he tries to be in his car constantly, even if he\u2019s not being paid, so that if he\u2019s suddenly allowed to log on, he can take advantage and have a better chance of moving up the tier system.                \u201cNo matter how hard I work, it\u2019s never enough. Every day is about how to get online so I can hit the quota and not be locked out,\u201d Tariq told Motherboard. \u201cWhere do I spend hours parked in the day? Where do I spend hours parked at night? When do I use the bathroom? When do I eat? If I hit the quota, I can relax. I can drive whenever I want. If I don\u2019t hit the quota, I get locked out.\u201d                He\u2019s fallen behind on his rent, car insurance, and vehicle payments, putting him dangerously close to having the vehicle                 remotely deactivated                then repossessed.                \u201cI don\u2019t want to sleep in my car, I don\u2019t want to spend most days away from home. But I have to,\u201d Tariq said. \u201cIf I don\u2019t hit the quota, I don\u2019t get the right to log on and drive whenever I want. If I can\u2019t drive whenever I want, then I get off-peak hours which means no customers. Which means no money. Which means I spend more hours in my car trying to hit the quota and make a living.\u201d                These changes, called the \u201clockout\u201d by drivers, have fundamentally changed what ridesharing is. Uber and Lyft have long said that drivers have the flexibility to choose their own hours\u2014this is, in fact, core to their argument that drivers are not \u201cemployees\u201d but are instead independent contractors. But new Uber and Lyft policies in New York City not only mean drivers can\u2019t make their own hours, and an increasing number of drivers are driving a minimum of 60 hours a week to avoid having their hours cut on the app.                 #DriversUnit caravan around New York City protesting low wages for Uber and Lyft drivers.                  Spencer Platt                 / Staff                In conversations with more than a dozen drivers, I learned of a multi-faceted crisis: a failure of the TLC to enforce its own ride-hail app regulations, an unsustainable rat race among drivers to meet the increasingly demanding quotas of Uber and Lyft, poor working conditions in which drivers who supposedly make their own hours have less agency than workers at traditional workplaces, growing financial insecurity, and a rapid decay in the physical and mental health of drivers caught in between exploitative gig platforms and ill-equipped bureaucracies.                All of this, of course, is exacerbated by the ongoing coronavirus crisis, which puts drivers on the front lines of a city that is \u201csocial distancing\u201d and avoiding public transit.                Motherboard has granted anonymity to ride-hail drivers who spoke to us for this story, because many of them expressed fear of retribution from Uber and Lyft. Names of drivers have been omitted or changed.                Even drivers who say they like the lockout have a pretty bleak view of what\u2019s happening: \u201cWhether we hate it or love it, this is capitalism in action: strong drivers over weak ones, the wheat from the chaff,\u201d one driver said.                *                Ride-hailing apps have had a simple strategy in New York City: growth at all costs. By 2019 there were                 well over                120,000 for-hire vehicles (FHVs) on the road\u2014fewer than 40,000 FHVs existed before Uber\u2019s first NYC experiment with ride-hailing in 2010. As of January, Uber and Lyft make up roughly                 97 percent                of the city\u2019s daily trips\u2014a far cry from January 2015 (the start of TLC\u2019s data collection), when Uber provided                 60,000 daily trips                compared to NYC yellow cabs\u2019                 450,000 daily trips                .                In a 2019 press conference                 celebrating                victory over the ride-hail companies after new regulations were imposed, Bhavari Desai\u2014executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance (NYTWA) labor group\u2014spoke plainly about why she and City Hall were opposed to Uber and Lyft: \"Uber and Lyft and their cohorts created a race to the bottom, filling our streets with so many vehicles that no driver could get enough fares to make a living.\"                Exponential growth, whether in a petri dish or the United States' largest city, is not sustainable. For years, studies have reported the same set of outcomes when ride-hail apps are mass adopted: worse                 traffic conditions                , increases in                 urban pollution                , mass migrations from                 public and private                transit, all paired with                 bleak unit economics                that constantly cut wages while hiking fares. Uber\u2019s commitment to                 growth                manifested differently in its various markets across the world, but in New York City the strategy meant a vicious battle with the city itself. When Mayor Bill de Blasio                 tried to introduce                a vehicle cap in 2015, Uber hired an army of lobbyists and consultants, launched                 \u201cDeBlasio\u2019s Uber\u201d                featuring 25 minute wait times, and \u201c                 convinced                \u201d the Mayor a study would be best.                For the next three years, the city adopted a relatively laissez-faire approach to ride-hail apps even as it became clear these apps were wreaking havoc on the city and its communities. It took a                 wave                of driver suicides,                 in-depth                 coverage                of New York City\u2019s                 taxi medallion bubble                , protests and campaigns led by labor groups like the                 Independent Drivers Guild                and NYTWA, and                 a June 2018 study                of proposed pay rules by economists James A. Parrot and Michael Reich to push the TLC to consider action. It\u2019s worth mentioning that the 2018 edition of the TLC's report to the City Council was the                 first                to specifically mention Uber or Lyft\u2014three years after the city\u2019s first effort to regulate the company.                In 2018, City Hall overwhelmingly passed two regulations. The first regulation was a one-year vehicle cap aimed at not only easing endemic congestion, but blocking the flood of FHVs spilling into the streets. The second regulation was permanent pay floor regulation meant to raise the sub-minimum wages which were driving some drivers into despair.                This pay floor used a company\u2019s \u201cutilization rate\u201d as part of a dynamic formula that set payment minimums. The TLC                 defines                a utilization rate as \u201cthe share of time drivers spend with passengers.\u201d The thinking here was that, without government regulation, an explosion of unutilized cars would lead to increased congestion and would continue to push wages down as more drivers would be driving without passengers (and thus without fares).                The Parrot-Reich study found that 96 percent of all high-volume FHV drivers made less than $17.22 hourly ($15 after expenses). They proposed to fix that by calculating each company\u2019s utilization rate, then plugging it into a per-minute and per-mile minimum trip payment formula.                 A visualization of how the pay floor formula works.                Each company\u2019s specific utilization rates were                 abysmal                : In 2017, Uber and Lyft had a 58 percent utilization rate, while it was 50 percent for Juno, and 70 percent for Via. The incentive, then, was to use utilization rate in the pay floor formula to stop perpetual growth and have drivers spend less time on the road empty, hopefully reducing congestion as well. The lower the utilization rate, the higher the per-trip pay floor. Without these rules and incentives, Parrot told Motherboard, drivers would \u201ccontinue to subsidize the company as they buy vehicles, maintain them, and drive for sub-minimum pay.\"                \u201cBefore the vehicle cap, the companies were just signing up drivers right and left. That was clearly unsustainable and needed to change. So the [New York City Council] supported a cap on vehicles\u2014the cap didn't come from the Taxi and Limousine Commission, it wasn't their regulation,\" Parrott said. \"The TLC maintained its position that they didn't have the authority\u2014clear-cut authority\u2014to act on their own. So they proceeded to get a handle on the volume of cars to regulate the pay and encourage regulation of vehicles by the companies. It was a set of policies that weren't coordinated from the beginning.\"                After the vehicle cap and pay floor were passed in 2018,                 a one-year study                of the effects of the vehicle cap and the pay floor\u2019s utilization rate on congestion was carried out and completed by summer 2019. The study\u2019s conclusions made the case for the TLC to propose not only indefinitely extending the cap but adding a \u201ccruising cap\u201d to limit how much time app-based FHVs could drive without passengers in Manhattan south of 96th Street. Within six months, app companies would need to reduce their cars\u2019 time spent idling from 41 percent to 36 percent, then down further to 31 percent within another six months.                Altogether, the regulations promised to radically change the lives of most app drivers by increasing their income, reducing the time they spent empty, and improving working conditions. Already, Uber and Lyft had                 stopped accepting new drivers                because the vehicle cap and pay floor made the companies, not the public, bear the brunt of the cost of perpetual growth. Lyft had                 tried                and                 failed                to block the vehicle cap and pay floor in court, and the cruising cap would surely draw fire from both, but the mood was high when Mayor de Blasio                 signed laws                that made the vehicle caps and pay scheme permanent in June.                \u201cWith this new policy, New York City is holding companies accountable for the underutilization of drivers and oversupply of vehicles that have choked the city\u2019s streets,\u201d said Acting TLC Commissioner Bill Heinzen at the time. \u201cThis innovative approach represents a major win for our hardworking drivers and the city as a whole. It shows how cities nationwide can take back control of their streets.\u201d                \u201cA cap on new For Hire Vehicles was the first step in stabilizing incomes for drivers in poverty, debt and despair across the industry. And with the minimum payment rates that followed, Uber and Lyft drivers are finally able to see gains,\u201d added Desai, executive director of the NYTWA. \u201cUber and Lyft and their cohorts created a race to the bottom, filling our streets with so many vehicles that no driver could get enough fares to make a living.\"                In all the fanfare, however, regulators overlooked the fact that Uber and Lyft became big precisely because                 they ignored regulations                . By the end of the year, both Uber and Lyft were able to                 kill the cruising cap                through the courts. To fight the new pay rules that used low utilization rates to increase driver pay, however, the apps would have to get more creative.                *                It took Lyft two weeks to undo years of work that made the vehicle cap and pay floor possible. On June 27 of last year, Lyft told its drivers it was introducing a                 \u201cpriority to drive\u201d                system: \u201cthe number of drivers who can be on the road at any given time will be determined by passenger demand\u2014and spots may be limited. This means if there\u2019s low demand, you may have to drive to busier areas or wait to go online and drive once demand picks back up.\u201d                To achieve and preserve priority to drive, drivers needed an acceptance rate above 90 percent and to complete 100 rides in 30 days. Drivers without priority would only be allowed to drive when there was enough demand. (An exception would be made, however, for drivers who                 rented a vehicle                from Lyft through its                 Express Drive                program, which drivers have long bemoaned for its resulting                 high costs and low pay                .) According to TLC data, the average                 number of ride-hailing trips per Lyft vehicle                in June 2019 was 96. In October, Lyft raised its priority to drive minimum to 180 rides every 30 days. At the time, the average                 number of trips for Lyft vehicles                that month was 113.                In a statement to Motherboard, a Lyft spokeswoman said: \u201cWe have said that the TLC\u2019s rules are misguided. To comply with them, we had to make changes to the app, and are working hard to support drivers through these changes.\u201d                In September, Uber announced it would be introducing its own version of priority driving: a \u201cPlanner\u201d that would allow drivers to schedule trips for the next week depending on what tier of its quota system a driver achieved last month. In one                 early communication                , Uber pinned the blame on the TLC: \u201cWe know that all the changes to the city's regulations since 2018 have been frustrating to drivers, and we're doing our very best to support you as we work to respond to the TLC's rules.\"                The first tier of drivers would be allowed to go online anytime, but only if they completed                 1,000 trips                in three months or 250 UberBlack/SUV (luxury) trips. The second tier of drivers, who completed 700 trips or 200 UberBlack/SUV trips in three months, were allowed to reserve shifts in the Planner at 10 AM every Wednesday. Drivers who completed at least 400 trips or 150 UberBlack/SUV trips were slotted into the third tier, allowed to reserve Planner shifts on Thursday at 10 AM each week. Every group was expected to maintain a 4.8 or higher rating; the fourth and final tier comprised drivers who either did not have a 4.8 rating or did not hit the third tier's quota. They would be allowed to reserve shifts after Friday at 10 AM. TLC data indicates the average number of monthly ride-hail trips per Uber vehicle at the time was 191.                 Uber's first trip quotas to determine access to the app and its planner.                In                 February                , Uber sent drivers details for its new quota starting in March, which are much higher than the previous quotas: 425 trips or 95 UberBlack/SUV to go online anytime; 285 trips or 65 Black/SUV trips to reserve on Wednesday at 10 AM; 165 trips or 35 UberBlack/SUV trips to reserve on Thursday at 10 AM. Again, each tier would require at least a 4.8 driver rating and anyone below the lowest quota tier or a 4.8 driver rating could only make reservations on Friday at 10 AM. By the end of 2019, TLC data reported that the average number of trips per Uber vehicle barely inched to 214.                 Uber's second trip quotas to determine access to the app and its planner.                To go online anytime, drivers have to complete an average of just over 14 rides                 per day                , assuming a 30-day month and that they drive                 every single day                . That means drivers in the top tier work a lot and need to continue working a lot. But they aren\u2019t the ones who have been screwed the worst by this system.                For any driver who is not already in the first tier, it requires a herculean effort to move into it, and it can require a lot of unpaid time sitting in the car. Drivers are given a number of reservation slots\u2014each one allows a driver to log on for one hour. The number of reservation slots drivers are allowed to has fluctuated from 23 to 17 to 14 to 11, and now seven for some. As each tier is allowed to register, there are also substantially fewer slots to reserve; there are weeks when Thursday reservations see either only off-peak times, low-demand times, or no slots at all. If drivers want to make up the difference, they are forced to sit in their car on the app constantly and hope that there will be a shortage of drivers somewhere, sometime, in the city that will unlock their access to the app. For most drivers, this means 60 to 70 hour weeks, every week, to hit a higher tier.                Essentially, many drivers are living in their cars, hoping they\u2019ll be allowed to log in often enough to be able to move up the tier system.                \"Uber can control when I work, where I work, how much I get paid. I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m sick, my body hurts and I can\u2019t live like this anymore.\"                \"In the past, I would only drive five or six hours on weeknights, then maybe 10 to 12 hours on weekend nights for extra money. But now, I'm mostly driving 12 hours every day and I'm only taking one day off,\u201d one Uber driver who has been working in the city for two years told Motherboard. \u201cI am scheduling shifts, I am forced to constantly go where Uber needs drivers, I don\u2019t get to control what I do. Not only that, but now I drive 30 to 40 percent more now\u2014and I'm not breaking even by any means. Before the lockout, on average I was making $1,500 each week after vehicle expenses if you include insurance, vehicle rentals, gas, cleaning, all that. Now it's $500 in a good week. I can\u2019t live on that, but I\u2019m trapped paying off this car that I got to drive Uber in the first place!\u201d                 One of the countless New York City driver caravans demanding fair pay.                  Spencer Platt                 / Staff                After repeated requests for comment, Uber declined to answer detailed questions from Motherboard. Instead, it sent the following statement: \"As a result of regulations passed by the TLC and actions taken by one of our competitors, we began limiting access to the driver app in areas and times of low rider demand.\"                Uber and Lyft\u2019s new policies fly in the face of what they have always insisted is the core of their business model and worker classification:                 flexibility.                At the same time, the New York City experience suggests that there has always existed a core tension between the viability of Uber\u2019s business model and the autonomy (and livelihood) of its drivers.                \u201cObviously you can\u2019t continue to grow 50 percent a year, indefinitely, forever and ever. When the pay standard was approved in 2019, the market had stabilized. In other places, it's not clear that the growth is continuing in an unsustainable fashion,\u201d said Parrot. \u201cThere was this early period where the companies were trying to portray the industry as something where drivers can drive whenever they can please, but that was obviously a myth.\u201d                For years, Uber has always maintained that profitability is just                 around the corner                . At times, it has been necessary to invoke the specter of                 autonomous vehicles                as proof of its inevitable profitability. Its loudest critics, however, have always maintained that not only is Uber a fundamentally unprofitable company but that it operates on                 bleak unit economics                which can only ever improve its margins by cutting driver compensation or hiking fares. This tension between flexibility and profitability becomes clearest, then, when cities like New York block Uber from cutting driver compensation.                \u201cIn less regulated markets, Uber's rhetorical claims that drivers are free to log in and logout or free to work at their own discretion are directly contradicted in a city like New York,\u201d said Alex Rosenblat, research lead for Data &amp; Society and author of                 Uberland: How Algorithms Are Rewriting the Rules of Work                . \u201cThe lockouts make it more explicit that Uber is controlling scheduling. Technically, drivers still have the option to secure shifts in advance, but of course if they can't make those shifts or they try and log in outside of those shifts, then their chances [of getting work] are spontaneous.\"                Rosenblat\u2019s ethnographic research of ride-hail drivers over the past few years has focused on                 \u201calgorithmic management,\u201d                or the ways in which the Uber/Lyft model of work actually resembles, and in many cases goes further than, traditional dynamics of employment: \"I would argue that they're currently controlling labor in lots of ways. By choosing how many drivers to onboard into a given market. By setting the rate that drivers earn\u2014by perennially changing them and often cutting them. By changing the requirements for vehicles. By monitoring their behavior at work, from how quickly they're accelerating to how harshly they're braking, to threatening drivers if they don't perform according to the behavioral standards that were set. That's the basic tenet of the algorithmic management argument.\u201d                *                In conversations Motherboard had with Uber and Lyft drivers around New York City, there was near-unanimous hatred for the lockout.                \u201cIf you don\u2019t already have priority, forget it. It\u2019s not worth it. And by the time I can reserve shifts on the Planner, the busiest slots are already gone. The shifts given by Uber aren\u2019t enough to hit 425 trips in a month, let alone enough to pay my bills!,\u201d one Lyft and Uber driver said while getting ready to sleep in the back of his car. \u201cThis is the only way. My entire life revolves around this stupid app if I want to eat, to sleep, to do anything. This isn\u2019t living.\u201d                Feelings ranged from accusatory, with drivers blaming not only Uber and Lyft but New York City regulatory authorities for taking too long to do something the apps broke within a few months, to dejected, as drivers either accepted living in their cars to \u201cearn\u201d the right to drive whenever they wanted or made plans to exit the gig economy industry and find another line of work.                Another driver who\u2019d spent the last three months sleeping in his car in order to take advantage of any demand spikes, was irate when Motherboard met him, specifically because of Uber\u2019s sudden increase in the quotas. \u201cMy plan was to work like a slave every day for half a year, maybe more, until I could save enough money to never do this shit again,\u201d he said. \u201cOK, Uber can control when I work, where I work, how much I get paid, alright fine, six months. But I\u2019m tired, I\u2019m sick, my body hurts and I can\u2019t live like this anymore.\u201d                \"I would like people to think about the lives of the drivers. Ask what happens to a person when they cannot sleep, cannot eat, cannot shit on their own time. Whether Uber or Lyft or Via or whatever stupid app is worth it.\"                One driver, Rafael, fancied himself as a sort of \u201ccrisis entrepreneur\u201d and explained that \u201cUber and Lyft are doing this because they fucked up by hiring too many drivers, but they\u2019ll fuck [up] again and cause too many drivers to leave, meaning people like me will be there to eat when there\u2019s too much demand and not enough supply.\u201d                \u201cSupply\u201d is exactly what Uber\u2019s co-founder and former CEO Travis Kalanick                 called drivers internally                years before Uber began scheduling drive shifts in a Planner to minimize labor costs. When that fact was pointed out to Rafael, he responded, \u201cThere\u2019s no harm in having clear eyes about how they see us. The real harm comes from people acting out some fantasy of \u2018being their own boss\u2019 when the apps control nearly everything.\u201d                While a consistent theme among drivers was the recognition that their labor\u2014and how, when, or where it was used\u2014was not exactly theirs to control, what varied widely was how drivers then rationalized that reality.                \"I think no one wants to go to work every day feeling disempowered, right, and I think people often come up with other narratives or other ways to describe their circumstances\u2014usually positively,\" said Rosenblat. \"I think what we are also describing is a very masculine way of approaching work, where you're going to sort of 'take it on the chin' and you're going to self-sweat because you've got a family to support.\"                Work on these platforms is always thought of in terms of these entrepreneurial narratives that tend to obscure core tensions between flexibility and profitability, or between autonomy and algorithmic management.                \"Whether or not you can handle the work is very different as a question than whether you should be deprived of workplace protections, or whether your employer should be providing extra levels of protection,\u201d Rosenblat said.                *                As Veena Dubal, a law professor at UC Hastings, observes in her case study of the California taxi industry,                 Drive to Precarity                , these conditions are a feature, not bug, of the ride-hailing industry everywhere. When                 comparing modern conditions                to those of pre-union San Francisco taxi workers who struck in 1919, she writes they too \"had no set income, paid for their own gasoline, and drove with no regulatory limit on competition. As an additional regression, the [ride-hail] drivers also had to drive their own cars, bear the costs of wear and tear, purchase gas and insurance, and pay for vehicle upkeep.\"                The Uber model is a return to the norm, not a deviation from it. And with little to no focus on                 worker classification in New York City                , other forces become the target of drivers\u2019 rage and frustration. Drivers take for granted that the \u201cgreedy apps,\u201d as some called them, are architects of their misery, but are also quick to blame other drivers, the TLC, the political establishment, and the media. Drivers often expressed frustration that despite the                 deluge                of                 reporting                on                 poor                working conditions, multiple studies empirically                 proving                 subminimum                 wages                , a wave of suicides among                 app-based drivers                and                 traditional taxi drivers                , all the expos\u00e9s on the                 fundamental exploitation                that                 underwrites                the                 UberLyft business model                , and                 fierce rhetoric                from politicians along with                 rounds of uncoordinated regulations                , things have only gotten worse.                 Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi.                  Riccardo Savi                 / Stringer                \u201cI think the scheduling of drivers is going to be a permanent feature. Otherwise, it\u2019s just that the companies would be leaving it to chance that the supply of drivers is going to match the demand for trips,\u201d Parrot told Motherboard. \u201cThere\u2019s a cost to the companies in missing the mark: if they don't have enough drivers, they can\u2019t service demand that exists and lose market share to other companies; if they have too many drivers scheduled at any given time, then they have makeup pay to satisfy the pay standard.\u201d                \u201cThere are too many drivers on the road. That, plus not enough demand, plus new minimum wage laws, plus the crooks at the TLC too scared to cap the number of drivers, and what do you get?\u201d one Uber driver who has worked in New York for five years told Motherboard just before he quit driving for the company. \u201cThe apps are doing the dirty work for the city. Uber and Lyft get to save their business, the TLC gets to save face, a few thousand drivers get to starve and a few more get to kill themselves\u2014who cares? That's why they haven't enforced the rules for almost a year now!\u201d                The TLC declined to comment on the record for this story.                Drivers have little hope for a fix to this issue. If anything, evidence suggests this development may be permanent, as Parrot suggested earlier.                *                Since Uber and Lyft stopped accepting new driver applications in April 2019, both apps have each                 lost                over 8,000 drivers. Tariq is now one of them. After years of eking by and after months of sleeping in his car, he can\u2019t take it anymore.                \"I can\u2019t lie and say I hated every moment. I like driving, I like talking to people, I like the silence you get sometimes. For me, it was a perfect job on paper. On paper,\u201d Tariq told Motherboard. \u201cBut the reality was horrible for me. So, I would like people to think about the lives of the drivers. Ask what happens to a person when they cannot sleep, cannot eat, cannot shit on their own time. Whether Uber or Lyft or Via or whatever stupid app is worth it. You get somewhere quicker, but me? I sleep in the car. I see the Planner in my dreams like I\u2019m some robot. I want to see my daughter and my wife in my dreams. I want to see my country and my home. Yes I\u2019m a driver, but I\u2019m a person too!\u201d                  Tagged:                   NEW YORK CITY                   labor                   gig economy                   Coronavirus                   Lyft                   rideshare                   ride hail                   gig work                      Get a personalized roundup of VICE's best stories in your inbox.                      <span>                       Subscribe        position: relative;

Or go to Twitter and try to find the phrase \"social distancing is not effective.\" It might be there, but probably not for long \u2014 because Twitter has banned the phrase as harmful.              A few years ago, these kinds of warnings and filters would have been hard to imagine. Most major consumer technology platforms embraced the idea that they were neutral players, leaving the flow of information up to users.              Now, facing the prospect that hoaxes or misinformation could worsen a global pandemic, tech platforms are taking control of the information ecosystem like never before. It's a shift that may finally dispose of the idea that Big Tech provides a \"neutral platform\" where the most-liked idea wins, even if it's a conspiracy theory.              \"What you're seeing is the platforms' being forced into a public health stand more than they've ever been before,\" said Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Center for Civic Media at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.              <strong>                 Full coverage of the coronavirus outbreak              \"It seems like the platforms have decided to take a clear stand, where they see COVID-19 as a significant enough public health problem that they're comfortable putting their thumb on the scale even if it runs the risk of some of their users claiming it's an unfair restriction on free speech,\" Zuckerman said.              From the start, major consumer internet companies had some rules. Most platforms didn't allow pornography or gore. As militants in the Middle East moved online, many companies \u2014 most notably               Google and Facebook              \u2014 worked to identify and remove content that tried to spread propaganda or recruit people. Still, those efforts weren't fully successful. YouTube, for example, wrongfully               removed video documentation              of human rights abuses as part of its campaign to delete terrorist-related content.              Beyond those narrow exceptions, tech companies resisted calls to influence what their users saw.              \"We are a tech company, not a media company,\" Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg               said in 2016              , insisting he wanted to build tools, not moderate content. In 2018, he said Facebook               shouldn't remove posts              that deny the existence of the Holocaust so users have room to make unintentional mistakes.                   <div class=\"absolute absolute-fill w100 df items-center items-center-m justify-center justify-center-m\">                 Coronavirus misinformation: When a pandemic leads to an \u2018infodemic\u2019                <span>                 March 13, 2020                <span>                 03:44              That began to change in recent years, as academics, politicians, civil rights groups and even               former employees              scrutinized companies and pushed for change amid               reports              of lackluster content moderation. While tech companies hadn't been making specific editorial decisions, the systems that determined what people saw \u2014 often based on complex algorithms that tried to maximize engagement \u2014 became the focus of intense criticism.              Tech companies reacted. Major platforms stepped up enforcement around hate speech and abuse. Many changed how their systems worked. YouTube pledged last year to               no longer recommend              conspiracy videos, while Twitter added a feature for users to               follow certain topics              selected by the company. Amazon               removed more than a dozen books              that unscientifically claimed that a homemade bleach, chlorine dioxide, could cure conditions from malaria to childhood autism.              Facebook now has an               elaborate               rulebook              on what stays up and what comes down, the result of countless internal meetings and feedback from lawmakers, interest groups and users. It has also been working on creating a body, independent at least in theory, that would rule on content removal questions almost               like a supreme court              .

It is internally inconsistent. It is illogical. It doesn't work as an idea.              \"So these tech platforms can claim neutrality all they want, but they have never been neutral from the very outset,\" she added.

Steve Pfost / Newsday RM via Getty Images              Many major tech platforms have gone beyond moderating coronavirus content to actively push messages from health professionals.              Instagram Chief Executive Adam Mosseri said Tuesday that the Facebook-owned service was being especially careful with recommendations, trying to vet accounts and posts before suggesting them to users. And he said it would take a hard line on bad medical advice.              Part of Instagram's push on the coronavirus has been to create a \"sticker\" with the phrase \"Stay Home.\" People who post to their Instagram stories with the sticker may have their posts picked up and distributed widely, encouraging others to take up social distancing.              \"Any misinformation related to COVID-19 that creates risk of real-world harm \u2014 we've seen things like \u2018drink bleach if you're feeling any of the symptoms' as, like, a dangerous thing to say, a dangerous piece of information about coronavirus \u2014 we will take off Instagram, whether or not it's from a politician, no matter who it's from,\" Mosseri said during a live chat.              Facebook has a coronavirus \"information center\" with tips on subjects like hand-washing, and a search on the app for the name of the virus turns up posts from sources such as Johns Hopkins University, the World Health Organization and the American Medical Association.              Zuckerberg himself has posted frequently on the subject, even hosting a senior U.S. health official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, for a               live video discussion              .              Twitter has laid out sweeping policy changes related to the coronavirus. Last week, the company said it was               broadening its definition of harm              to cover 11 categories of tweets that it will ask users to remove, from denying health authority recommendations to describing ineffective treatments.              <strong>                Download the                 NBC News app                for full coverage and alerts about the coronavirus outbreak              \u201cWe recognize that people are increasingly coming to Twitter to find credible and authoritative information about the pandemic and we take that responsibility very seriously,\u201d Twitter said in a statement Tuesday.              Twitter's moves drew applause from comedian Sacha Baron Cohen, a harsh critic of tech companies, who thanked Twitter \"for putting facts and science ahead of misinformation and profit.\"                 With coronavirus, lies and conspiracies will literally kill us.                 History will judge social media companies by what they do now.                 Thank you                  @Twitter                 for putting facts and science ahead of misinformation and profit.                \u2014 Sacha Baron Cohen (@SachaBaronCohen)                 March 19, 2020              These efforts, however, have their limits.              Misinformation is still spreading far and wide about the coronavirus, including               through messaging apps              such as WhatsApp and iMessage. Snopes, the fact-checking organization, said Monday that               it is overwhelmed              by coronavirus misinformation.              \"In moments where there's a lot of uncertainty, we will gravitate towards any information that has a unique or novel take on the problem. People share it because they aren't seeing it in other places,\" said Joan Donovan, research director of Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy.              Donovan, who researches disinformation campaigns, said the pandemic shows the value of labels on social media posts. Reddit, which has a               thriving message board              on the               coronavirus              , allows posts on the science behind the virus to be tagged as peer-reviewed or not.              \"If our posts are not being curated and tagged with very important markers of legitimacy, then we don't know what to trust, and we start looking for other signals,\" she said.              Tech companies are also likely to take some steps back after the outbreak is over.              Politicians may not object when Instagram is working to suppress hoaxes about the coronavirus, but they have voiced serious concerns about moderation of many other topics.              \"When they have pressure in the media from people saying, \u2018You're controlling my speech,' my experience is that Facebook is very, very sensitive to that pressure, especially from the right,\" said Zuckerman of MIT.              Zuckerberg, for one, doesn't seem to think he's setting a precedent for how Facebook will act in future cases of misinformation.              \"When you're dealing with a pandemic, a lot of the stuff we're seeing just crossed the threshold,\" the Facebook CEO told The New York Times in an               interview about the coronavirus              . \"So it's easier to set policies that are a little more black and white and take a much harder line.\"            <div class=\"articleBylineContainer mt8\">                David Ingram               David Ingram covers tech for NBC News.

Despite a company-wide mandate, however, the social networking giant had not figured out how to conduct its most sensitive work remotely: removing pornography, terrorism, hate speech and other unwanted content from across its site.           The people who do that sensitive work \u2014 nearly 15,000 contractors at 20 sites globally \u2014 continued to come to the office until last Monday, when public pressure, internal protests and quarantine measures around the world pushed Facebook to make a drastic move to shutter its moderation offices.           But Facebook\u2019s decision to place that army of moderators on paid leave paves the way for another challenge, forcing the company to police disinformation, medical hoaxes, Russian trolls and the general ugliness of the Internet without them.            AD            AD            Facebook, Google and Twitter scramble to stop misinformation about coronavirus           While Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other companies have long touted artificial intelligence and algorithms as the future of policing problematic content, they\u2019ve more recently acknowledged that humans are the most important line of defense. Those contractors, who are paid a fraction of what full-time workers earn, spend hours a day reviewing material flagged as illegal or disturbing, removing posts that cross the line and            often suffering psychological harm           from the exposure.           Still, chief executive Mark Zuckerberg said on a media call Wednesday that Facebook will be forced during the pandemic to rely more heavily on artificial intelligence software to make those judgment calls. The company also will train full-time employees to devote \u201cextra attention\u201d to highly sensitive content, such as any involving suicide, child exploitation and terrorism. Users should expect more mistakes while Facebook triages the process, he said, in part because a fraction of the humans will be involved and because software makes more blunt decisions than humans.           Zuckerberg acknowledged the decision could result in \u201cfalse positives,\u201d including removal of content that should not be taken down.

It will \u201ccreate a trade-off against some other types of content that may not have as imminent physical risks for people.\u201c Still, he hopes to train more people as quickly as possible because he was \u201cpersonally quite worried that the isolation from people being at home could potentially lead to more depression or mental health issues, and we want to make sure that we are ahead of that in supporting our community.\u201d           Zuckerberg\u2019s admission reflects the complex choices and trade-offs Silicon Valley giants are making in the face of a mounting global health crisis. The companies can protect workers and comply with local stay home orders. But that choice could jeopardize the safety of the billions of users around the world, many of whom are quarantined at home, on the Internet all day and exposed to more potentially disturbing material than before.           YouTube also            announced temporary plans           last week to rely more heavily on automated systems to reduce the number of people in the office, something the company warned could prompt a slower appeals process for video content creators and more unreviewed content barred from search or its homepage. The same day,            Twitter said           it would do the same. Because the automated systems may cause mistakes, it won\u2019t permanently suspend accounts during this time. It\u2019s also triaging to prioritize policing potentially more harmful violations.            AD            AD           Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and other social media companies have faced significant past challenges to policing content, from the live video posted during the Christ Church, New Zealand, shooting to disinformation campaigns by Russian trolls during the 2016 presidential election. The decision to send workers home comes during a presidential election year when foreign and domestic users are actively trying to shape public debate using disinformation that might be spotted only by a human eye.           That pressure is heightened as disinformation regarding the novel coronavirus surges. On Facebook-owned WhatsApp,            chat groups           are spreading unverified information about flights, hotels and schools in connection with the virus, as well as misinformation about potential government crackdowns and how the disease is spreading. On Facebook, a            fake letter circulated           about an outbreak in Los Angeles, and there were pervasive posts about fake cures and falsehoods that the U.S. government created coronavirus.           It\u2019s not just social media: Some consumers are getting fake texts to their phones warning of a nationwide lockdown.            AD            AD            White House asks Silicon Valley for help to combat coronavirus, track its spread and stop misinformation           Following the 2016 presidential election, Facebook in particular hired thousands of third-party moderators in the Philippines, India, Dublin and the United States to police the site and shore up its reputation. The moderators, who work for outsourcing companies like Accenture and Cognizant, are contractors and typically receive less pay and fewer benefits than actual employees.           The decision to send the humans home and rely more on technology to police the sites concerned some researchers.           \u201cThey haven\u2019t made enough leaps and bounds in artificial intelligence to take away the best tool we have: human intelligence to do the discernment,\u201d said Mary Gray, senior principal researcher at Microsoft Research and co-author of \u201cGhost Work: How to Stop Silicon Valley from Building a New Global Underclass.\u201d            AD            AD           \u201cThis is a mess.\u201d            Millions of tweets peddled conspiracy theories about coronavirus in other countries, an unpublished U.S. report says           \u201cWe\u2019re focused on keeping people safe and informed while making sure they can share information and connect with one another during this crisis,\" said Facebook spokesman Drew Pusateri. \"But as we said in a recent update on our content review, we anticipate that some mistakes will occur as we adjust to a modified workforce with a heavier reliance on automation.\u201d           Facebook is making the change in large part because it considers the work too sensitive for third party moderators to do from home because, among other reasons, it involves reviewing people\u2019s private Facebook accounts. The company also acknowledges it is a traumatic job and workers would receive less support at home. Typically, moderators work in call centers where every movement, from breaks to keystrokes to judgments over content, is heavily managed and monitored.            AD            AD           The company says that may change as the coronavirus emergency evolves.            Content moderators at YouTube, Facebook and Twitter see the worst of the web \u2014 and suffer silently           Facebook offered more clarity on its plans in a company blog post            late Thursday           . When users report content for violating policy, they will see a message explaining there are fewer reviews and Facebook is prioritizing content that poses the greatest potential harm.           \u201cThis means some reports will not be reviewed as quickly as they used to be and we will not get to some reports at all,\u201d according to the blog post. Reducing the workforce also will alter the appeals process for users who believe their content was removed in error. People can still report they disagree with Facebook\u2019s decision.            AD           We\u2019ll \u201dmonitor that feedback to improve our accuracy, but we likely won\u2019t review content a second time,\u201d the company said.           Roughly 95 percent of posts involving adult nudity, terrorism, child exploitation, suicide and self-harm that the company ultimately takes down are flagged by algorithms before Facebook users have a chance to report them, according to the company\u2019s latest community standards enforcement            report           . (The company does not attempt to estimate the total number of problematic posts that appear on the platform, only whether the content that was taken down was reported.)            AD           But for more nuanced categories of speech, the company\u2019s systems often are less effective. Artificial intelligence catches only 16 percent of posts involving bullying and harassment on Facebook, resulting in more than 80 percent of posts reported to the company. Artificial intelligence catches about 80 percent of hate speech.            AD           Those numbers have led company officials to realize human judgment still is necessary to monitor more sensitive areas of speech, such as racism and political disinformation.           \u201cI think there will always be people\u201d making judgment calls over content, Zuckerberg said in a            Washington Post interview           last year.            Silicon Valley\u2019s two-tiered system for white-collar workers is under pressure as coronavirus spreads           Already there are signs of potential problems. Early last week, legitimate articles with accurate information about the virus were being removed from Facebook. Zuckerberg said it was caused by a bug in the company\u2019s spam detection system that was unrelated to its triaging of content moderation during the pandemic. \u201cThe system is fixed, those posts are back up, and hopefully we won\u2019t have that issue again anytime soon,\u201d he said on the media call last week.            AD           As Facebook moves to a more technology-driven response to policing content, it will prove a major test for the industry, said Jeff Kosseff, a cybersecurity professor and author of \u201cThe 26 Words That Created the Internet.\u201d           \u201cIt will tell us a lot about the state of automated moderation,\u201d Kosseff said. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know what exactly tech companies are doing and how effective it is,\u201d although they have been more transparent.           UCLA professor            Sarah T. Roberts           , author of \u201cBehind the Screen: Content Moderation in the Shadows of Social Media,\u201d said Facebook\u2019s hand may have been forced. In Manila, the Filipino capital where Facebook indirectly employs thousands of content moderators, the government            enacted           a citywide quarantine.           Regardless of Facebook\u2019s motivation, Roberts said the experience will reveal how much human reviewers impact our collective well-being and experience of the Internet. It may even shift the Silicon Valley ideology that places a primacy on problem-solving through engineering.           \u201cWe actually might not be able to code our way out of coronavirus,\u201d she said.

But as we struggle to catch up with countries that have successfully pushed back on the outbreak, we start to see new dangers in the weapons we deploy to fight this disease, including some of those used abroad.              As federal, state and local governments increasingly contemplate               big tech and mass surveillance              as a tool to combat the spread of the deadly virus, we must guard against surveillance opportunists who will endanger public health and the health of our democracy. For some Americans, the consequences of expanded data collection could be as deadly as the disease itself.               As much as this surveillance might seem like a smart way to fight the pandemic, these programs can get it wrong.              As we\u2019ve seen in               China              ,               Taiwan              and               South Korea              , every facet of modern life can become a tool for tracking the virus\u2019s spread. Whether it\u2019s the government using cellphone tower data to track the movement of travelers from Wuhan to other parts of China, or pushing for using new apps that predict if users have been exposed to the disease, or gathering information from social media to map where users are posting from, our digital lives are becoming medical diagnostic tools.              As much as this surveillance might seem like a smart way to fight the pandemic, these programs can get it wrong. There is a profound risk that these types of artificial intelligence systems will mirror the prejudices of their human designers, falsely targeting Asian Americans and other marginalized groups. There is also the risk that they drive many of those who have been infected into the shadows, worsening the spread. And once the period of contagion is over, these emergency surveillance tools may easily be co-opted for other purposes -- everything from tracking graffitiing to tax evasion -- making Orwellian surveillance a permanent part of American life.

Users seeking tests at participating facilities log in with their google account, enter their health data, then get a referral to COVID-19 testing if they are deemed a priority.              Making Google part of the national emergency response (               long before it was agreed to by Google               caused privacy advocates to ask what would happen with the data.              The law is completely unclear on whether this data can also be used by government agencies ranging from public health authorities to Immigration and Customs Enforcement.                   <div class=\"absolute absolute-fill w100 df items-center items-center-m justify-center justify-center-m\">                 There is no way to fix Facebook.

Take a moment to imagine what it is like for undocumented immigrants living through the coronavirus crisis. For those who have the symptoms of COVID-19, a trip to the emergency room could bring a death sentence: deportation to a far-off country even less equipped to handle the threat of the pandemic. If even a small fraction of undocumented immigrants feel unsafe getting medical treatment, the virus could expand.              Similarly, those Americans who have outstanding police warrants may also be dissuaded from handing their information to public-private partnerships. And some Americans will avoid registration on ideological grounds to avoid giving corporate entities or the government their intimate health details.

The potential for far-reaching consequences from faulty technology is also greatly enhanced by using surveillance widely to cope with this pandemic. For instance, it\u2019s not that far out to imagine government officials using current tracking software such as               HealthMap              (which scours social media sites for flu-related words to identify incipient flu outbreaks) or               Flu Near You              (which asks its users to self-identify their flulike symptoms) to impose quarantines or otherwise restrict people\u2019s movements; local governments in Chicago and New York have relied on similar programs that scraped people\u2019s social media for terms related to foodborne illnesses in order to               identify and shut down restaurants prone to food poisoning              .              But despite successes using these apps for food poisoning               and the flu              , the effectiveness of this sort of mass surveillance system is decidedly unclear, especially if expanded more broadly by relying on cellphone locations and internet history. Previously, systems might have been able to guess who had seasonal flu based on their Google queries, for example, but in the midst of this pandemic nearly every American is running these same searches. Other attempts to develop this technology, such as Google Flu Trends,               were abandoned as failures.              Moreover, using artificial intelligence to determine who can leave their home or take transit raises the risk of AI bias. In the U.S. (and particularly New York City), where               housing is appallingly segregated              , it\u2019s easy to imagine how AI could lead to a form of COVID-19 redlining or otherwise replicate the worst shortcomings of \u201cpredictive policing,\u201d               which often draws on racially biased crime data to recommend even more racially biased policing.              Ultimately, there\u2019s the threat this technology poses to our civil rights and the rule of law. Government access to this type of tracking and personal data means officials will have the power to exclude people from society, effectively subjecting them to home confinement without trial, appeal or any semblance of due process. It\u2019s an appealing response when the government gets that decision right, but a chilling power if abused.              In China, residents have been forced to install phone apps that track their movements and assign them a red, green or yellow coronavirus score. Get a bad score and suddenly               public transportation, work and school are out of bounds              . And, as people in China are learning, when a computer program quarantines you, that               automated judgment can be impossible to challenge and reverse              . Disturbingly,               there\u2019s growing evidence that the expanded behavioral tracking will stick around long after the crisis is over,              giving Beijing a new way to track religious minorities and political dissidents.               Taking evidence-based steps to protect public health will save lives in the coming days, but any damage we do to our Constitution may not heal for decades.              In the weeks ahead, we must be vigilant. Whether it was the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II, the profiling of Muslim Americans following the terror attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, or the mass incarceration for petty and nonviolent crimes when crime rates spiked in the \u201980s and \u201990s, our rights are most at risk when we feel scared. And the changes we accept in times of crisis can last far longer than the immediate crisis.              In the weeks following 9/11, Congress hastily expanded surveillance powers through the USA PATRIOT Act. Many of those emergency provisions were originally supposed to expire more than a decade ago. This week,               Congress voted to renew them yet again              . Taking evidence-based steps to protect public health will save lives in the coming days, but any damage we do to our Constitution may not heal for decades.            <div class=\"articleBylineContainer mt8\">                Albert Fox Cahn               Albert Fox Cahn is the founder and executive director of The Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (S.T.O.P.), a New York-based civil rights and privacy group.

While the internet provides opportunity for many to live with some modicum of normalcy amid the outbreak, millions of Americans do not have reliable access to the web. Also many industries ranging from auto-manufacturing to hospitality cannot be conducted online. Because of this stark digital divide, many are at risk of educational lapses, profound social isolation or unemployment, advocates warn.             'Suddenly I have no paycheck': layoffs and cuts for workers rocked by coronavirus             Read more         According to the          Pew Research Center         , 29% of adults with household incomes less than $30,000 a year don\u2019t own a smartphone, while 44% don\u2019t have home broadband and 46% lack a \u201ctraditional\u201d computer either. Pew also noted that 35% of lower-income households with school-age children don\u2019t have a home-based broadband internet connection.         Tom Sheppard, a Bronx resident with two daughters and one son attending          New York         City public schools, which have closed until at least 20 April due to coronavirus, said: \u201cDepending on where you live, you either have incredible access to technology or you don\u2019t.\u201d         The city will launch remote learning on 23 March. Officials in New York City said this will include providing devices to students who don\u2019t have them, and working with internet companies to provide web access. Sheppard described the tech side of this launch as \u201ca slow-motion trainwreck\u201d.         \u201cEvery school has plenty of support resources for teachers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut there\u2019s nothing available for parents. So what does technical support look like? Nobody knows,\u201d said Sheppard, who has home internet but is deeply involved with this issue as a parent advocate.         Some of the devices distributed to families are outdated, he said, and \u201calmost completely unusable technology, generally speaking\u201d.         \u201cPart of it is internet access,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd so you\u2019re basically giving them technology that doesn\u2019t connect to the internet \u2013 you\u2019re basically handing out paperweights.         \u201cThere aren\u2019t public places that kids can go to now because everything is shut down,\u201d he added. \u201cEverybody says \u2018the library\u2019. They shut down the library system last week.\u201d         Te\u00f3filo Reyes, director of programs and research for Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, pointed out that workers in this industry are reeling on more than one level.         \u201cRight now, the fact that restaurants are shutting down, and the fact that the government has limited paid sick leave, means that they\u2019re completely devoid of ways of making a living,\u201d he said.         While some states have enacted measures to make unemployment insurance readily available, allowing people to apply without going into an office, doing so requires reliable internet access, he said.         \u201cPeople need to be able to access the forms online, fill out the forms online, be able to sign the forms online, and be able to send them online,\u201d he said. Though many restaurant workers skew younger, he said, that doesn\u2019t mean they will be equipped to do so with their technology. \u201cThey\u2019re savvy with using technology on their phones, but they haven\u2019t had to use it to fill out government or bureaucratic documents, which can be a lot of more daunting.\u201d         And, he said, there are also older workers who might not have internet access, or \u201cwho would not be as literate in accessing all this information online\u201d.

Photograph: Peter Foley/EPA         The potential for widespread disparity due to the digital divide is underscored by how broadly in-person activities have come to a halt amid Covid-19.         Thirty-nine US states have decided to shutter schools. When added to local closures, a minimum of 91,000 public and private school pupils have been affected by similar mandates, Education Week          reported         . Many districts have implemented distance learning policies, so that students can continue their lessons via the internet.         In California, San Francisco and five other Bay Area counties have mandated that all residence          shelter-in-place         to stop the spread of coronavirus \u2013 the first such order in the US. New York City\u2019s Mayor Bill de Blasio mentioned the possibility of such an order , though the state governor, Andrew Cuomo, insisted this wouldn\u2019t happen. Cuomo did say, however, that he would issue an executive order requiring that non-essential businesses implement work-from-home policies starting 20 March.         Under this order, businesses which require in-office workers are nonetheless required to cut their in-office staffing by 50%.         Eve Anthony, president and CEO of the Athens Community Council on Aging, in Georgia, said that many suggestions for combatting          social isolation         in seniors are web-based, which can leave many behind.          \u201c         Some of the things that you hear, as recommendations for seniors, involve digital access \u2013 stay connected via social media and FaceTime, and all of those other things,\u201d she said, but \u201cso many in those populations don\u2019t have access to that\u201d.         One of Anthony\u2019s clients who has a laptop typically goes to restaurants to connect with free wifi. Because of the outbreak, she can\u2019t go to these venues.         \u201cShe wants access to information, and you know, what she\u2019s being told is \u2018get on the CDC website, get on the Social Security Administration website, you can even talk to the hospital via the [web] portal,\u2019\u201d Anthony said. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have access to any of that.         \u201cRight now, it\u2019s a big challenge, and two weeks from now, I hope to be able to say, we have a solution, but right now no one is reaching out to us to say we have a solution for you,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take our time and our advocacy to see that seniors aren\u2019t forgotten.\u201d          Topics             Coronavirus outbreak             New York             Georgia             Internet             Smartphones             features              Share on Facebook              Share on Twitter              Share via Email              Share on LinkedIn              Share on Pinterest              Share on WhatsApp              Share on Messenger              Reuse this content         Most popular         World         Europe         US         Americas         Asia         Australia         Middle East         Africa         Inequality         Global development        News        Opinion        Sport        Culture        Lifestyle         Contact us         Complaints &amp; corrections         SecureDrop         Work for us         Privacy policy         Cookie policy         Terms &amp; conditions         Help         All topics         All writers         Digital newspaper archive         Facebook         Twitter         Advertise with us         Search UK jobs         Dating         Discount Codes         Support The\u00a0Guardian         Available for everyone, funded by readers        Contribute        Subscribe       Back to top      \u00a9 2020 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

If you\u2019re only going to load one specific subset a single time, you can use chunking. But what if you need to load different subsets of the data at different times? Loading the whole file each time will be slow. What you need is a searchable index, and one easy (and fast!) way to do that is with SQLite.\u201d                             </span>                             <br/>                               ITAMAR TURNER-TRAURING                              </a>                             </span>                             <br/>                             <br/>                               Scout APM for Python                              </a>                             </span>                             <br/>                             </a>                              Check out Scout\u2019s developer-friendly application performance monitoring solution for Python.

The subsequentthread went in a few different directions that reflect the nature of themailing list\u2014and the idea itself.      Jorgensen prefaced his thoughts with a disclaimer of sorts: \"       This is      \".  He suggested that adding a\"dunder\" method to Python objects for pretty-printing purposes. Thosemethods have names that start and end with double underscoresstandard tasks       ).  A new one might allow objects torepresent themselves differently in Unicode streams:writing the representation to a stream, and the stream has a Unicodeencoding, then those might prefer to represent themselves as \"\u221e\" and\"-\u221e\". If there were a dunder method for informal representation to whichthe destination stream was passed, then the object could decide how torepresent itself based on the properties of the stream.      Beyond that, objects might like to control how they are pretty-printed inthe general case.       pprint      provides some amount of customization, in terms oftext width, indentation, and traversal depth, but he is looking for more      It would be nice ifthere were some method that, if implemented for the object, would be usedto allow the object to tell the pretty printer to treat it is a compositewith starting text, component objects, and ending text.      Guido van Rossum       thought      the idea had some merit.  He suggested that a       pprint      alternative \"       that allows classes to have formatting hooks that get passed in some additional information (or perhaps a PrettyPrinterobject) that can affect the formatting      \" might make sense.  It wouldbe the type of feature that could be developed as independent modules onthe       Python Package Index       *except* it would be more effective if there was a standard, ratherthan several competing such modules, with different APIs for the formatting hooks      \".  He encouraged a discussion on what thatAPI might look like.      Jonathan Fine       offered      up some potential starting points, at least in terms of design, in the        reprlib      and        json      modules in the standard library.  Eric V. Smith       pointedto      the        @functools.singledispatch      decorator as a potential pattern to use; it allows for overloaded functionsbased on the type of the first argument.      But the definition of some putative      method on objectscould be problematic, Barry Scott       said       in the eye of the beholder      \", so he is skepticalthat objects can define a one-size-fits-all implementation; for example,internationalization and localization might be required.  Instead ofdriving it from the object side, he would rather have something that takesan object \"       and returns the pretty version depending onthe apps demands/config      \".  Stephen J. Turnbull more or less       concurred      with that:      Allowing objects to decide implicitly how to represent themselves iscool that you can do things like \"\u03c0 = math.pi\", and with MacroPy youcan even do things like substitute \"\u03bb\" for \"lambda\".  However, ifways are provided to do this automatically depending on encodings andother variable environment state, people *will* put them into publiclibraries, and clients of those libraries will have to compensate forthat.  And of course there's the potential for foot-shooting inprivate libraries.       If an application wants to make such substitutions, I have noobjection to that.  But \"explicit is better than implicit\", and thosesubstitutions should be made at the level of application I/O, not thethat's still an appropriate informal principle, I think.)      Christopher Barker was       concerned      that adding a new dunder method for pretty-printing, beyond the existing      and      , might just lead to the need for more than one versionof \"pretty\".  He wondered about updating      for standardtypes, so that the output was \"pretty\" by default, but recognized that itwould likely break many things: \"       I imagine a LOT of code out there(doctests, who know what else) does in fact expect the str() of builtinsnot to change -- so this is probably dead in the water.      \"   Butbeyond the code (and documentation) upheaval, it is far from clear what       pointedout      Define \"pretty\". The main reason I don't use the pprint module at the moment is that it formats things like lists into a single long, thin column which is *less* attractive than the unformatted list:       I've inserted the ellipsis for brevity, the real output is 200 rows        When it comes to floats, depending on what I'm doing, I may consider any         the minimum number of digits which are sufficient to round trip;        the mathematically exact value, which could take a lot of digits;        some short number of digits, say, 5, that is \"close enough\".      Turnbull       agreed      withBarkerthat        doctest      -basedtests would be affected by a change to      (which calls      if present), but that other things would be broken aswell, which is something that the project tries to avoid:      Python may be good for developerswho are moving fast and breaking things, but that's partly because(despite frequent complaints to the contrary) we don't move fast andbreak things most of the time.      Beyond the standard library modules, Alex Hall       noted      two projects on GitHub that may be of interest:       PrettyPrinter      and      .  Jorgensen       said      that he is looking at those as well as the others suggested in the thread.He is       continuing      the discussion, but is now thinking that adding dunder methods is not theright approach:      There has been some argument regarding whether objects should say how topresent themselves \"prettily\". I think a case can be made either way, butin either case, it makes sense that it should be easy to override therepresentation for an object type without subclassing or monkey-patchingit. Also, it might make sense not to clutter up the dunder-method space forall kinds of objects with this kind of thing.      Instead, he suggested adding a way for objects to register hooks governinghow they want to be represented.  It is still in the early going for anypretty-printing improvements; Jorgensen posted his initial message onMarch\u00a015.  Any wrangling over an API is still down the road a bit; aPEP andchanges to the language, if any, are further out still.  But there doesseem to be a contingent that favors a feature of this sort, so it may wellwork its way into, say, Python\u00a03.10, presumably sometime in 2021.

Since that's already in the standard library, I'm not sure I understand what they are proposing... Maybe you could add a fallback option where reprlib.Repr.repr1() dispatches to some dunder method on the object (with the expectation that the object call back into repr1() when it wants to format a subobject)? That seems messy, since I usually think of dunder methods as belonging to the language rather than the standard library. But there is precedent for this sort of thing (e.g. __copy__ and __deepcopy__), so I suppose it could work.      Improving pretty-printing in Python       Posted Mar 21, 2020 7:22 UTC (Sat) by        divbzero        Link       I don\u2019t have a strong opinion on this, but would note that the debate over a __pretty__ method seems to parallel the debate over a __json__ method. [1] [2]        __json__ has not gained traction, probably because JSON serialization can be application dependent and JSONDecoder already provides a flexible way to customize JSON serialization.        __pretty__ seems even more in the eye of the beholder so I\u2019m not surprised to see hesitant reactions to the idea.

It determines the visibility of a variable within the code. The scope of a name or variable depends on the place in your code where you create that variable. The Python scope concept is generally presented using a rule known as the        LEGB rule       The letters in the acronym LEGB stand for        Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in       scopes. This summarizes not only the Python scope levels but also the sequence of steps that Python follows when resolving names in a program.        In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn:        What         scopes        are and how they work in Python        Why it\u2019s important to know about         Python scope        What the         LEGB rule        is and how Python uses it to resolve names        How to modify the         standard behavior        of Python scope using         global        and         nonlocal        What         scope-related tools        Python offers and how you can use them       With this knowledge at hand, you can take advantage of Python scopes to write more reliable and maintainable programs. Using Python scope will help you avoid or minimize bugs related to name collision as well as bad use of global names across your programs.       You\u2019ll get the most out of this tutorial if you\u2019re familiar with intermediate Python concepts like        classes        functions        inner functions        variables        exceptions        comprehensions        built-in functions       , and standard data structures.

Remove ads       Understanding Scope       In programming, the        scope       of a name defines the area of a program in which you can unambiguously access that name, such as variables, functions, objects, and so on. A name will only be visible to and accessible by the code in its scope. Several programming languages take advantage of scope for avoiding name collisions and unpredictable behaviors. Most commonly, you\u2019ll distinguish two general scopes:          Global scope:         The names that you define in this scope are available to all your code.          Local scope:         The names that you define in this scope are only available or visible to the code within the scope.       Scope came about because early programming languages (like BASIC) only had        global names       . With this kind of name, any part of the program could modify any variable at any time, so maintaining and debugging large programs could become a real nightmare. To work with global names, you\u2019d need to keep all the code in mind at the same time to know what the value of a given name is at any time. This was an important side-effect of not having scopes.       Some languages like Python use        scope       to avoid this kind of problem. When you use a language that implements scope, there\u2019s no way for you to access all the variables in a program at all locations in that program. In this case, your ability to access a given name will depend on where you\u2019ve defined that name.         Note:        You\u2019ll be using the term         name        to refer to the identifiers of variables, constants, functions, classes, or any other object that can be assigned a name.       The names in your programs will have the scope of the block of code in which you define them. When you can access the value of a given name from someplace in your code, you\u2019ll say that the name is        in scope       . If you can\u2019t access the name, then you\u2019ll say that the name is        out of scope       Names and Scopes in Python       Since Python is a        dynamically-typed       language, variables in Python come into existence when you first assign them a value. On the other hand, functions and classes are available after you define them using         def       or         class       , respectively. Finally,        modules       exist after you import them. As a summary, you can create Python names through one of the following operations:           Operation           Statement            Assignments            x = value            Import operations            import module           or            from module import name           Function definitions           Argument definitions in the context of functions           Class definitions       All these operations create or, in the case of assignments, update new Python names because all of them assign a name to a variable, constant, function, class, instance, module, or other Python object.         Note:        There\u2019s an important difference between         assignment operations        and         reference or access operations        . When you reference a name, you\u2019re just retrieving its content or value. When you assign a name, you\u2019re either creating that name or modifying it.       Python uses the location of the name assignment or definition to associate it with a particular scope. In other words, where you assign or define a name in your code determines the scope or visibility of that name.       For example, if you assign a value to a name inside a function, then that name will have a        local Python scope       . In contrast, if you assign a value to a name outside of all functions\u2014say, at the top level of a module\u2014then that name will have a        global Python scope       Python Scope vs Namespace       In Python, the concept of scope is closely related to the concept of the        namespace       . As you\u2019ve learned so far, a Python scope determines where in your program a name is visible. Python scopes are implemented as        dictionaries       that map names to objects. These        dictionaries       are commonly called        namespaces       . These are the concrete mechanisms that Python uses to store names. They\u2019re stored in a special attribute called       Names at the top level of a module are stored in the module\u2019s namespace. In other words, they\u2019re stored in the module\u2019s       attribute. Take a look at the following code:       After you import         sys       , you can use       to inspect the keys of       . This returns a        list       with all the names defined at the top level of the module. In this case, you can say that       holds the namespace of        sys       and is a concrete representation of the module scope.         Note:        The output of some of the examples in this tutorial has been abbreviated (        ) to save space. The output may vary based on your platform, Python version, or even on how long you\u2019ve been using your current Python interactive session.       As a further example, suppose that you need to use the name        ps1       , which is defined in        sys       . If you know how       and namespaces work in Python, then you can reference        ps1       in at least two different ways:        Using the         dot notation        on the module\u2019s name in the form         module.name        Using a         subscription operation        on        in the form       Take a look at the following code:       Once you\u2019ve imported        sys       you can access        ps1       using the dot notation on        sys       . You can also access        ps1       using a dictionary key lookup with the key       . Both actions return the same result,         Note:          ps1        is a         string        specifying the primary prompt of the Python interpreter.         ps1        is only defined if the interpreter is in interactive mode and its initial value is       Whenever you use a name, such as a variable or a function name, Python searches through different scope levels (or namespaces) to determine whether the name exists or not. If the name exists, then you\u2019ll always get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get an error. You\u2019ll cover this search mechanism in the next section.        Remove ads       Using the LEGB Rule for Python Scope       Python resolves names using the so-called        LEGB rule       , which is named after the Python scope for names. The letters in LEGB stand for Local, Enclosing, Global, and Built-in. Here\u2019s a quick overview of what these terms mean:          Local (or function) scope         is the code block or body of any Python function or           lambda         expression. This Python scope contains the names that you define inside the function. These names will only be visible from the code of the function. It\u2019s created at function call,          not         at function definition, so you\u2019ll have as many different local scopes as function calls. This is true even if you call the same function multiple times, or recursively. Each call will result in a new local scope being created.          Enclosing (or nonlocal) scope         is a special scope that only exists for nested functions. If the local scope is an          inner or nested function         , then the enclosing scope is the scope of the outer or enclosing function. This scope contains the names that you define in the enclosing function. The names in the enclosing scope are visible from the code of the inner and enclosing functions.          Global (or module) scope         is the top-most scope in a Python program, script, or module. This Python scope contains all of the names that you define at the top level of a program or a module. Names in this Python scope are visible from everywhere in your code.          Built-in scope         is a special Python scope that\u2019s created or loaded whenever you          run a script         or open an interactive session. This scope contains names such as keywords, functions,          exceptions         , and other attributes that are built into Python. Names in this Python scope are also available from everywhere in your code. It\u2019s automatically loaded by Python when you run a program or script.       The LEGB rule is a kind of name lookup procedure, which determines the order in which Python looks up names. For example, if you reference a given name, then Python will look that name up sequentially in the local, enclosing, global, and built-in scope. If the name exists, then you\u2019ll get the first occurrence of it. Otherwise, you\u2019ll get an error.         Note:        Notice that the local and enclosing Python scopes are searched only if you use a name inside a function (local scope) or a nested or inner function (local and enclosing scope).       In summary, when you use nested functions, names are resolved by first checking the local scope or the innermost function\u2019s local scope. Then, Python looks at all enclosing scopes of outer functions from the innermost scope to the outermost scope. If no match is found, then Python looks at the global and built-in scopes. If it can\u2019t find the name, then you\u2019ll get an error.       At any given time during execution, you\u2019ll have at most four active Python scopes\u2014local, enclosing, global, and built-in\u2014depending on where you are in the code. On the other hand, you\u2019ll always have at least two active scopes, which are the global and built-in scopes. These two scopes will always be available for you.       Functions: The Local Scope       The        local scope       or function scope is a Python scope created at function calls. Every time you call a function, you\u2019re also creating a new local scope. On the other hand, you can think of each        def       statement and        lambda       expression as a blueprint for new local scopes. These local scopes will come into existence whenever you call the function at hand.       By default, parameters and names that you assign inside a function exist only within the function or local scope associated with the function call. When the function returns, the local scope is destroyed and the names are forgotten. Here\u2019s how this works:       is a function that computes the square of a given number,        base       . When you call the function, Python creates a local scope containing the names        base       (an argument) and        result       (a local variable). After the first call to        base       holds a value of        10       and        result       holds a value of        100       . The second time, the local names will not remember the values that were stored in them the first time the function was called. Notice that        base       now holds the value        20       and        result       holds        400         Note:        If you try to access         result        or         base        after the function call, then you get a          NameError        , because these only exist in the local scope created by the call to        . Whenever you try to access a name that isn\u2019t defined in any Python scope, you\u2019ll get a         NameError        . The error message will include the name that couldn\u2019t be found.       Since you can\u2019t access local names from statements that are outside the function, different functions can define objects with the same name. Check out this example:       Notice that you define       using the same variable and parameter that you used in       . However, since       can\u2019t see the names inside the local scope of       and vice versa, both functions work as expected without any name collision.       You can avoid name collisions in your programs by properly using the local Python scope. This also makes functions more self-contained and creates maintainable program units. Additionally, since you can\u2019t change local names from remote places in your code, your programs will be easier to debug, read, and modify.       You can inspect the names and parameters of a function using       , which is an attribute that holds information on the function\u2019s internal code. Take a look at the code below:       In this code example, you inspect       on       . This is a special attribute that holds information about the code of a Python function. In this case, you see that       holds a tuple containing the names that you define inside        Remove ads       Nested Functions: The Enclosing Scope        Enclosing or nonlocal scope       is observed when you nest functions inside other functions. The enclosing scope was        added in Python 2.2       . It takes the form of the local scope of any enclosing function\u2019s local scopes. Names that you define in the enclosing Python scope are commonly known as        nonlocal names       . Consider the following code:       When you call       , you\u2019re also creating a local scope. The local scope of       is, at the same time, the enclosing scope of       . From inside       , this scope is neither the global scope nor the local scope. It\u2019s a special scope that lies in between those two scopes and is known as the        enclosing scope         Note:        In a sense,        is a temporary function that comes to life only during the execution of its enclosing function,        . Note that        is only visible to the code in       All the names that you create in the enclosing scope are visible from inside       , except for those created after you call       . Here\u2019s a new version of       that shows this point:       When you call       the code runs down to the point in which you call       . The last statement of       tries to access        another_var       . At this point,        another_var       isn\u2019t defined yet, so Python raises a        NameError       because it can\u2019t find the name that you\u2019re trying to use.       Last but not least, you can\u2019t modify names in the enclosing scope from inside a nested function unless you declare them as        nonlocal       in the nested function. You\u2019ll cover how to use        nonlocal        later       in this tutorial.       Modules: The Global Scope       From the moment you start a Python program, you\u2019re in the global Python scope. Internally, Python turns your program\u2019s main script into a module called       to hold the main program\u2019s execution. The namespace of this module is the main        global scope       of your program.         Note:        In Python, the notions of global scope and global names are tightly associated with module files. For example, if you define a name at the top level of any Python module, then that name is considered global to the module. That\u2019s the reason why this kind of scope is also called         module scope       If you\u2019re working in a Python interactive session, then you\u2019ll notice that       is also the name of its main module. To check that out, open an interactive session and type in the following:       Whenever you run a Python program or an interactive session like in the above code, the interpreter executes the code in the module or script that serves as an entry point to your program. This module or script is loaded with the special name,       . From this point on, you can say that your main global scope is the scope of       To inspect the names within your main global scope, you can use       . If you call       without arguments, then you\u2019ll get the list of names that live in your current global scope. Take a look at this code:       When you call       with no arguments, you get the list of names available in your main global Python scope. Note that if you assign a new name (like        var       here) at the top level of the module (which is       here), then that name will be added to the list returned by         Note:        You\u2019ll cover        in more detail         later on        in this tutorial.       There\u2019s only one global Python scope per program execution. This scope remains in existence until the program terminates and all its names are forgotten. Otherwise, the next time you were to run the program, the names would remember their values from the previous run.       You can access or reference the value of any global name from any place in your code. This includes functions and classes. Here\u2019s an example that clarifies these points:       Inside       , you can freely access or reference the value of        var       . This has no effect on your global name        var       , but it shows you that        var       can be freely accessed from within       . On the other hand, you can\u2019t assign global names inside functions unless you explicitly declare them as global names using a         global        statement       , which you\u2019ll see later on.       Whenever you assign a value to a name in Python, one of two things can happen:        You         create        a new name        You         update        an existing name       The concrete behavior will depend on the Python scope in which you\u2019re assigning the name. If you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, then you\u2019ll be creating that name in the function\u2019s local scope, shadowing or overriding the global name. This means that you won\u2019t be able to change most variables that have been defined outside the function from within the function.       If you follow this logic, then you\u2019ll realize that the following code won\u2019t work as you might expect:       Within       , you try to increment the global variable,        var       . Since        var       isn\u2019t declared        global       inside       , Python creates a new local variable with the same name,        var       , inside the function. In the process, Python realizes that you\u2019re trying to use the local        var       before its first assignment (        var + 1       ), so it raises an        UnboundLocalError       Here\u2019s another example:       You likely expect to be able to print the global        var       and be able to update        var       later, but again you get an        UnboundLocalError       . What happens here is that when you run the body of       , Python decides that        var       is a local variable because it\u2019s assigned within the function scope. This isn\u2019t a bug, but a design choice. Python assumes that names assigned in the body of a function are local to that function.         Note:        Global names can be updated or modified from any place in your global Python scope. Beyond that, the         global        statement can be used to modify global names from almost any place in your code, as you\u2019ll see in         The          global         Statement        Modifying global names is generally considered bad programming practice because it can lead to code that is:          Difficult to debug:         Almost any statement in the program can change the value of a global name.          Hard to understand:         You need to be aware of all the statements that access and modify global names.          Impossible to reuse:         The code is dependent on global names that are specific to a concrete program.        Good programming practice recommends using local names rather than global names. Here are some tips:          Write         self-contained functions that rely on local names rather than global ones.          Try         to use unique objects names, no matter what scope you\u2019re in.          Avoid         global name modifications throughout your programs.          Avoid         cross-module name modifications.          Use         global names as constants that don\u2019t change during your program\u2019s execution.       Up to this point, you\u2019ve covered three Python scopes. Check out the following example for a summary on where they\u2019re located in your code and how Python looks up names through them:       When you call       , you get        100       printed on your screen. But how does Python look up the name        number       in this case? Following the LEGB rule, you\u2019ll look up        number       in the following places:         Inside        This is the local scope, but         number        doesn\u2019t exist there.         Inside        This is the enclosing scope, but         number        isn\u2019t defined there either.         In the module scope:        This is the global scope, and you find         number        there, so you can print         number        to the screen.       If        number       isn\u2019t defined inside the global scope, then Python continues the search by looking at the built-in scope. This is the last component of the LEGB rule, as you\u2019ll see in the next section.        Remove ads        builtins       : The Built-In Scope       The        built-in scope       is a special Python scope that\u2019s implemented as a standard library module named         builtins       in Python 3.x. All of Python\u2019s built-in objects live in this module. They\u2019re automatically loaded to the built-in scope when you run the Python interpreter. Python searches        builtins       last in its LEGB lookup, so you get all the names it defines for free. This means that you can use them without importing any module.       Notice that the names in        builtins       are always loaded into your global Python scope with the special name       , as you can see in the following code:       In the output of the first call to       , you can see that       is always present in the global Python scope. If you inspect       itself using       , then you\u2019ll get the whole list of Python built-in names.       The built-in scope brings more than 150 names to your current global Python scope. For example, in        Python 3.8       you can get to know the exact number of names as follows:       With the call to       , you get the number of items in the        list       returned by       . This returns 152 names that include exceptions, functions, types, special attributes, and other Python built-in objects.       Even though you can access all of these Python built-in objects for free (without importing anything), you can also explicitly import        builtins       and access the names using the dot notation. Here\u2019s how this works:       You can import        builtins       as you would any other Python module. From this point on, you can access all the names in        builtins       by using the dotted attribute lookup or        fully-qualified names       . This can be quite useful if you want to make sure that you won\u2019t have a name collision if any of your global names override any built-in name.       You can override or redefine any built-in name in your global scope. If you do so, then keep in mind that this will affect all your code. Take a look at the following example:       If you override or re-assign        abs       , then the original built-in       is affected all over your code. Now, suppose that you need to call the original       and you forget that you re-assigned the name. In this case, when you call       again, you\u2019d get a        TypeError       because        abs       now holds a reference to an integer, which is not callable.         Note:        Accidentally or inadvertently overriding or redefining built-in names in your global scope can be a source of dangerous and hard-to-find bugs. It\u2019s better to try and avoid this kind of practice.       If you\u2019re experimenting with some code and you accidentally re-assign a built-in name at the interactive prompt, then you can either restart your session or run        del name       to remove the redefinition from your global Python scope. This way, you\u2019re restoring the original name in the built-in scope. If you revisit the example of       , then you can do something like this:       When you delete the custom        abs       name, you\u2019re removing the name from your global scope. This allows you to access the original       in the built-in scope again.       To work around this kind of situation, you can explicitly import        builtins       and then use fully-qualified names, like in the following code fragment:       Once you explicitly import        builtins       , you have the module name available in your global Python scope. From this point on, you can use fully-qualified names to unambiguously get the names you need from        builtins       , just like you did with       in the above example.       As a quick summary, some of the implications of Python scope are shown in the following table:           Action           Global Code           Local Code           Nested Function Code           Access or reference names that live in the global scope           Yes           Yes           Yes           Modify or update names that live in the global scope           Yes           No (unless declared            global           )           No (unless declared            global           )           Access or reference names that live in a local scope           No           Yes (its own local scope), No (other local scope)           Yes (its own local scope), No (other local scope)           Override names in the built-in scope           Yes           Yes (during function execution)           Yes (during function execution)           Access or reference names that live in their enclosing scope           N/A           N/A           Yes           Modify or update names that live in their enclosing scope           N/A           N/A           No (unless declared            nonlocal           )       Additionally, code in different scopes can use the same name for different objects. This way, you can use a local variable named        spam       and also a global variable with the same name,        spam       . However, this is considered bad programming practice.        Remove ads       Modifying the Behavior of a Python Scope       So far, you\u2019ve learned how a Python scope works and how they restrict the visibility of variables, functions, classes, and other Python objects to certain portions of your code. You now know that you can access or reference        global names       from any place in your code, but they can be modified or updated from within the global Python scope.       You also know that you can access        local names       only from inside the local Python scope they were created in or from inside a nested function, but you can\u2019t access them from the global Python scope or from other local scopes. Additionally, you\u2019ve learned that        nonlocal names       can be accessed from inside nested functions, but they can\u2019t be modified or updated from there.       Even though Python scopes follow these general rules by default, there are ways to modify this standard behavior. Python provides two keywords that allow you to modify the content of global and nonlocal names. These two keywords are:           global           nonlocal       In the next two sections, you\u2019ll cover how to use these Python keywords to modify the standard behavior of Python scopes.       The        global       Statement       You already know that when you try to assign a value to a global name inside a function, you create a new local name in the function scope. To modify this behavior, you can use a         global        statement       . With this statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as global names.       The statement consists of the        global       keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. You can also use multiple        global       statements with a name (or a list of names). All the names that you list in a        global       statement will be mapped to the global or module scope in which you define them.       Here\u2019s an example where you try to update a global variable from within a function:       When you try to assign        counter       inside       , Python assumes that        counter       is local to       and raises an        UnboundLocalError       because you\u2019re trying to access a name that isn\u2019t defined yet.       If you want this code to work the way you expect here, then you can use a        global       statement as follows:       In this new version of       , you add the statement        global counter       to the body of the function right before you try to change        counter       . With this tiny change, you\u2019re mapping the name        counter       in the function scope to the same name in the global or module scope. From this point on, you can freely modify        counter       inside       . All the changes will reflect in the global variable.       With the statement        global counter       , you\u2019re telling Python to look in the global scope for the name        counter       . This way, the expression        counter = counter + 1       doesn\u2019t create a new name in the function scope, but updates it in the global scope.         Note:        The use of         global        is considered bad practice in general. If you find yourself using         global        to fix problems like the one above, then stop and think if there is a better way to write your code.        For example, you can try to write a self-contained function that relies on local names rather than on global names as follows:        This implementation of        defines         counter        as a parameter and returns its value augmented by         1        unit every time the function is called. This way, the result of        depends on the         counter        you use as an input and not on the changes that other functions (or pieces of code) can perform on the global variable,         global_counter       You can also use a        global       statement to create lazy global names by declaring them inside a function. Take a look at the following code:       When you call       , you\u2019re also creating a global variable called        lazy       . Notice that after calling the function, the name        lazy       is available in the global Python scope. If you inspect the global namespace using       , then you\u2019ll see that        lazy       appears last in the list.         Note:        Even though you can use a         global        statement to create lazy global names, this can be a dangerous practice that can lead to buggy code. So, it\u2019s best to avoid things like this in your code.        For example, suppose you\u2019re trying to get access to one of those lazy names and, for some reason, your code hasn\u2019t called the function that creates that name yet. In this case, you\u2019ll get a         NameError        and your program will crash.       Finally, it\u2019s worth noting that you can use        global       from inside any function or nested function and the names listed will always be mapped to names in the global Python scope.       Also notice that, even though using a        global       statement at the top level of a module is legal, it doesn\u2019t make much sense because any name assigned in the global scope is already a global name by definition. Take a look at the following code:       The use of a        global       statement like        global name       doesn\u2019t change anything in your current global scope, as you can see in the output of       . The variable        name       is a global variable whether you use        global       or not.        Remove ads       The        nonlocal       Statement       Similarly to global names, nonlocal names can be accessed from inner functions, but not assigned or updated. If you want to modify them, then you need to use a         nonlocal        statement       . With a        nonlocal       statement, you can define a list of names that are going to be treated as nonlocal.       The        nonlocal       statement consists of the        nonlocal       keyword followed by one or more names separated by commas. These names will refer to the same names in the enclosing Python scope. The following example shows how you can use        nonlocal       to modify a variable defined in the enclosing or nonlocal scope:       With the statement        nonlocal var       , you tell Python that you\u2019ll be modifying        var       inside       . Then, you increment        var       using an        augmented assignment operation       . This change is reflected in the nonlocal name        var       , which now has a value of        200       Unlike        global       , you can\u2019t use        nonlocal       outside of a nested or enclosed function. To be more precise, you can\u2019t use a        nonlocal       statement in either the global scope or in a local scope. Here\u2019s an example:       Here, you first try to use a        nonlocal       statement in the global Python scope. Since        nonlocal       only works inside an inner or nested function, you get a         SyntaxError       telling you that you can\u2019t use        nonlocal       in a module scope. Notice that        nonlocal       doesn\u2019t work inside a local scope either.         Note:        For more detailed information on the         nonlocal        statement, check out         PEP 3104 \u2014 Access to Names in Outer Scopes       In contrast to        global       , you can\u2019t use        nonlocal       to create lazy nonlocal names. Names must already exist in the enclosing Python scope if you want to use them as nonlocal names. This means that you can\u2019t create nonlocal names by declaring them in a        nonlocal       statement in a nested function. Take a look at the following code example:       In this example, when you try to define a nonlocal name using        nonlocal lazy_var       , Python immediately raises a        SyntaxError       because        lazy_var       doesn\u2019t exist in the enclosing scope of       Using Enclosing Scopes as Closures        Closures       are a special use case of the enclosing Python scope. When you handle a nested function as data, the statements that make up that function are packaged together with the environment in which they execute. The resulting object is known as a closure. In other words, a        closure       is an inner or nested function that carries information about its enclosing scope, even though this scope has completed its execution.         Note:        You can also call this kind of function a         factory        , a         factory function        , or\u2014to be more precise\u2014a         closure factory        to specify that the function builds and returns closures (an inner function), rather than classes or instances.       Closures provide a way to retain state information between function calls. This can be useful when you want to write code based on the concept of        lazy or delayed evaluation       . Take a look at the following code for an example of how closures work and how you can take advantage of them in Python:       Your closure factory function       takes an argument called        exp       . You can use this function to build closures that run different power operations. This works because each call to       gets its own set of state information. In other words, it gets its value for        exp         Note:        Variables like         exp        are called         free variables        . They are variables that are used in a code block but not defined there. Free variables are the mechanism that closures use to retain state information between calls.       In the above example, the inner function       is first assigned to        square       . In this case, the function remembers that        exp       equals        2       . In the second example, you call       using        3       as an argument. This way,        cube       holds a function object, which remembers that        exp       is        3       . Notice that you can freely reuse        square       and        cube       because they don\u2019t forget their respective state information.       For a final example on how to use closures, suppose that you need to calculate the mean of some sample data. You collect the data through a stream of successive measurements of the parameter you\u2019re analyzing. In this case, you can use a closure factory to generate a closure that remembers the previous measurements in the sample. Take a look at the following code:       The closure that you create in the above code remembers the state information of        sample       between calls of        current_mean       . This way, you can solve the problem in an elegant and        Pythonic       way.       Notice that if your data stream gets too large, then this function can become a problem in terms of memory usage. That\u2019s because with each call to        current_mean        sample       will hold a bigger and bigger list of values. Take a look at the following code for an alternative implementation using        nonlocal       Even though this solution is more verbose, you don\u2019t have an endlessly growing list anymore. You now have a single value for        total       and        length       . This implementation is a lot more efficient in terms of memory consumption than the previous solution.       Finally, you can find some examples of using closures in the Python standard library. For example,         functools       provides a function named       that makes use of the closure technique to create new function objects that can be called using predefined arguments. Here\u2019s an example:       You use        partial       to build a function object that remembers the state information, where        exp=2       . Then, you call this object to perform the power operation and get the final result.        Remove ads       Bringing Names to Scope With        import       When you write a Python program, you typically organize the code into several modules. For your program to work, you\u2019ll need to bring the names in those separate modules to your       module. To do that, you need to        import       the modules or the names explicitly. This is the only way you can use those names in your main global Python scope.       Take a look at the following code for an example of what happens when you import some standard modules and names:       You first import         sys       and         os       from the Python standard library. By calling       with no arguments, you can see that these modules are now available for you as names in your current global scope. This way, you can use dot notation to get access to the names that are defined in        sys       and        os         Note:        If you want to dive deeper into how imports work in Python, then check out         Absolute vs Relative Imports in Python       In the latest        import       operation, you use the form       . This way, you can use the imported name directly in your code. In other words, you don\u2019t need to explicitly use the dot notation.       Discovering Unusual Python Scopes       You\u2019ll find some Python structures where name resolution seems not to fit into the LEGB rule for Python scopes. These structures include:         Comprehensions         Exception blocks         Classes and instances       In the next few sections, you\u2019ll cover how Python scope works on these three structures. With this knowledge, you\u2019ll be able to avoid subtle errors related to the use of names in these kinds of Python structures.       Comprehension Variables Scope       The first structure you\u2019ll cover is the         comprehension       . A comprehension is a compact way to process all or part of the elements in a collection or sequence. You can use comprehensions to create        lists        dictionaries       , and        sets       Comprehensions consist of a pair of brackets (       ) or curly braces (       ) containing an expression, followed by one or more        for       clauses and then zero or one        if       clause per        for       clause.       The        for       clause in a comprehension works similarly to a traditional         for        loop       . The loop variable in a comprehension is local to the structure. Check out the following code:       Once you run the list comprehension, the variable        item       is forgotten and you can\u2019t access its value anymore. It\u2019s unlikely that you need to use this variable outside of the comprehension, but regardless, Python makes sure that its value is no longer available once the comprehension finishes.       Note that this only applies to comprehensions. When it comes to regular        for       loops, the loop variable holds the last value processed by the loop:       You can freely access the loop variable        item       once the loop has finished. Here, the loop variable holds the last value processed by the loop, which is        4       in this example.        Remove ads       Exception Variables Scope       Another atypical case of Python scope that you\u2019ll encounter is the case of the        exception variable       . The exception variable is a variable that holds a reference to the        exception       raised by a         try        statement       . In Python 3.x, such variables are local to the        except       block and are forgotten when the block ends. Check out the following code:        err       holds a reference to the exception raised by the        try       clause. You can use        err       only inside the code block of the        except       clause. This way, you can say that the Python scope for the exception variable is local to the        except       code block. Also note that if you try to access        err       from outside the        except       block, then you\u2019ll get a        NameError       . That\u2019s because once the        except       block finishes, the name doesn\u2019t exist anymore.       To work around this behavior, you can define an auxiliary variable out of the        try       statement and then assign the exception to that variable inside the        except       block. Check out the following example:       You use        ex       as an auxiliary variable to hold a reference to the exception raised by the        try       clause. This can be useful when you need to do something with the exception object once the code block has finished. Note that if no exception is raised, then        ex       remains        None       Class and Instance Attributes Scope       When you define a class, you\u2019re creating a new local Python scope. The names assigned at the top level of the class live in this local scope. The names that you assigned inside a        class       statement don\u2019t clash with names elsewhere. You can say that these names follow the LEGB rule, where the class block represents the        L       level.       Unlike functions, the class local scope isn\u2019t created at call time, but at execution time. Each class object has its own       attribute that holds the class scope or namespace where all the        class attributes       live. Check out this code:       When you inspect the keys of       you\u2019ll see that        attr       is in the list along with other special names. This dictionary represents the class local scope. The names in this scope are visible to all instances of the class and to the class itself.       To get access to a class attribute from outside the class, you need to use the dot notation as follows:       Inside the local scope of        A       , you can access the class attributes directly, just like you did in the statement       . To access any class attribute once the code block of the class is executed, you\u2019ll need to use the dot notation or        attribute reference       , as you did with        A.attr       . Otherwise, you\u2019ll get a        NameError       , because the attribute        attr       is local to the class block.       On the other hand, if you try to access an attribute that isn\u2019t defined inside a class, then you\u2019ll get an         AttributeError       . Check out the following example:       In this example, you try to access the attribute        undefined       . Since this attribute doesn\u2019t exist in        A       , you get an        AttributeError       telling you that        A       doesn\u2019t have an attribute named        undefined       You can also access any class attribute using an instance of the class as follows:       Once you have the instance you can access the class attributes using the dot notation, as you did here with        obj.attr       . Class attributes are specific to the class object, but you can access them from any instances of the class. It\u2019s worth noting that class attributes are common to all instances of a class. If you modify a class attribute, then the changes will be visible in all instances of the class.         Note:        Think of the dot notation as if you were telling Python, \u201cLook for the attribute called         attr        in         obj        . If you find it, then give it back to me.\u201d       Whenever you call a class, you\u2019re creating a new instance of that class. Instances have their own       attribute that holds the names in the instance local scope or namespace. These names are commonly called        instance attributes       and are local and specific to each instance. This means that if you modify an instance attribute, then the changes will be visible only to that specific instance.       To create, update, or access any instance attribute from inside the class, you need to use         self       along with the dot notation. Here,        self       is a special attribute that represents the current instance. On the other hand, to update or access any instance attribute from outside the class, you need to create an instance and then use the dot notation. Here\u2019s how this works:       The class        A       takes an argument called        var       , which is automatically doubled inside       using the assignment operation       . Note that when you inspect       on        obj       , you get a dictionary containing all instance attributes. In this case, the dictionary contains only the name        var       , whose value is now        200         Note:        For a more on how classes work in Python, check out         Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming in Python       Even though you can create instance attributes within any method in a class, it\u2019s good practice to create and initialize them inside       . Take a look at this new version of        A       Here, you modify        A       to add a new method called       . Then, you create an instance of        A       by passing in        100       to the class initializer. After that, you can now call       on        obj       to duplicate the value stored in        self.var       . Finally, if you try to access        var       using the class object instead of an instance, then you\u2019ll get an        AttributeError       because instance attributes can\u2019t be accessed using class objects.       In general, when you\u2019re writing        object-oriented       code in Python and you try to access an attribute, your program takes the following steps:        Check the         instance        local scope or namespace first.        If the attribute is not found there, then check the         class        local scope or namespace.        If the name doesn\u2019t exist in the class namespace either, then you\u2019ll get an          AttributeError       This is the underlying mechanism by which Python resolves names in classes and instances.       Although classes define a class local scope or namespace, they don\u2019t create an enclosing scope for methods. Therefore, when you\u2019re implementing a class, references to attributes and methods must be done using the dot notation:       Since classes don\u2019t create an enclosing scope for methods, you can\u2019t access        var       directly from within       like you try to do here. To get access to class attributes from inside any method, you need to use the dot notation. To fix the problem in this example, change the statement       inside       to       and see what happens.       You can override a class attribute with an instance attribute, which will modify the general behavior of your class. However, you can access both attributes unambiguously using the dot notation like in the following example:       The above class has an instance attribute and a class attribute with the same name        var       . You can use the following code to access each of them:         Instance:        Use         self.var        to access this attribute.         Class:        Use         A.var        to access this attribute.       Since both cases use the dot notation, there are no name collision problems.         Note:        In general, good         OOP        practices recommend not to shadow class attributes with instance attributes that have different responsibilities or perform different actions. Doing so can lead to subtle and hard-to-find bugs.       Finally, notice that the class       and the instance       are totally different and independent dictionaries. That\u2019s why class attributes are available immediately after you run or import the module in which the class was defined. In contrast, instance attributes come to life only after an object or instance is created.        Remove ads       Using Scope Related Built-In Functions       There are many built-in functions that are closely related to the concept of Python scope and namespaces. In previous sections, you\u2019ve used       to get information on the names that exist in a given scope. Besides       , there are some other built-in functions that can help you out when you\u2019re trying to get information about a Python scope or namespace. In this section, you\u2019ll cover how to work with:       Since all these are built-in functions, they\u2019re available for free in the built-in scope. This means that you can use them at any time without importing anything. Most of these functions are intended to be used in an interactive session to get information on different Python objects. However, you can find some interesting use cases for them in your code as well.       In Python,       is a built-in function that returns a reference to the current global scope or namespace dictionary. This dictionary always stores the names of the current module. This means that if you call       in a given module, then you\u2019ll get a dictionary containing all the names that you\u2019ve defined in that module, right before the call to       . Here\u2019s an example:       The first call to       returns a dictionary containing the names in your       module or program. Note that when you assign a new name at the top level of the module, like in       , the name is added to the dictionary returned by       An interesting example of how you can use       in your code would be to dynamically dispatch functions that live in the global scope. Suppose you want to dynamically dispatch platform-dependent functions. To do this, you can use       as follows:       If you run this script in your command line, then you\u2019ll get an output that will depend on your current platform.       Another example of how to use       would be to inspect the list of        special names       in the global scope. Take a look at the following list comprehension:       This list comprehension will return a list with all the special names that are defined in your current global Python scope. Note that you can use the       dictionary just like you would use any regular dictionary. For example, you can        iterate       through it through it using these traditional methods:       You can also perform regular subscription operations over       by using square brackets like in       . For example, you can modify the content of       even though this isn\u2019t recommended. Take a look at this example:       Here, you change the key       to include a        docstring       for       so that from now on, the main module\u2019s docstring will have the value       Another function related to Python scope and namespaces is       . This function updates and returns a dictionary that holds a copy of the current state of the local Python scope or namespace. When you call       in a function block, you get all the names assigned in the local or function scope up to the point where you call       . Here\u2019s an example:       Whenever you call       inside       , the resulting dictionary contains the name        var       mapped to the value        100       and        arg       mapped to        300       . Since       only grabs the names assigned before you call it,        another       is not in the dictionary.       If you call       in the global Python scope, then you\u2019ll get the same dictionary that you would get if you were to call       When you call       in the global Python scope, you get a dictionary that\u2019s identical to the dictionary returned by the call to       Note that you shouldn\u2019t modify the content of       because changes may have no effect on the values of local and free names. Check out the following example:       When you try to modify the content of        var       using       , the change doesn\u2019t reflect in the value of        var       . So, you can say that       is only useful for read operations since updates to the        locals       dictionary are ignored by Python.        Remove ads       is a Python built-in function that returns the       attribute of a module, class, instance, or any other object which has a dictionary attribute. Remember that       is a special dictionary that Python uses to implement namespaces. Take a look at the following examples:       When you call       using        sys       as an argument, you get the       of        sys       . You can also call       using different types of Python objects, as long as they have this dictionary attribute.       Without any argument,       acts like       and returns a dictionary with all the names in the local Python scope:       Here, you call       at the top level of an interactive session. With no argument, this call returns a dictionary containing all the names in the global Python scope. Note that, at this level,       and       return the same dictionary.       If you call       with an object that doesn\u2019t have a       , then you\u2019ll get a        TypeError       , like in the following example:       If you call       with an integer object, then you\u2019ll get a         TypeError       because this type of Python object doesn\u2019t have a       You can use       without arguments to get the list of names in the current Python scope. If you call       with an argument, then the function attempts to return a        list       of valid attributes for that object:       If you call       with no arguments, then you get a list containing the names that live in the global scope. You can also use       to inspect the list of names or attributes of different objects. This includes functions, modules, variables, and so on.       Even though the        official documentation       says that       is intended for interactive use, you can use the function to provide a comprehensive list of attributes of a given object. Note that you can also call       from inside a function. In this case, you\u2019ll get the list of names defined in the function scope:       In this example, you use       inside       . When you call the function, you get a list containing the names that you define in the local scope. It\u2019s worth noting that in this case,       only shows the names you declared before the function call.       Conclusion       The        scope       of a variable or name defines its visibility throughout your code. In Python, scope is implemented as either a Local, Enclosing, Global, or Built-in scope. When you use a variable or name, Python searches these scopes sequentially to resolve it. If the name isn\u2019t found, then you\u2019ll get an error. This is the general mechanism that Python uses for name resolution and is known as the        LEGB rule        You\u2019re now able to:         Take        advantage of Python scope to avoid or minimize bugs related to name collision         Make        good use of global and local names across your programs to improve code maintainability         Use        a coherent strategy to access, modify, or update names across all your Python code       Additionally, you\u2019ve covered some scope-related tools and techniques that Python offers and how you can use them to gather information about the names that live in a given scope or to modify the standard behavior of Python scope. Of course, there\u2019s more to this topic that\u2019s outside the scope of this tutorial, so get out there and continue to tackle name resolution in Python!       \ud83d\udc0d Python Tricks \ud83d\udc8c           Get a short &amp; sweet            Python Trick           delivered to your inbox every couple of days.

This release, 3.9.0a5 is the fifth of six planned alpha releases.Alpha releases are intended to make it easier to test the current state of new features and bug fixes and to test the release process.During the alpha phase, features may be added up until the start of the beta phase (2020-05-18) and, if necessary, may be modified or deleted up until the release candidate phase (2020-08-10).  Please keep in mind that this is a preview release and its use is         not        recommended for production environments.        Major new features of the 3.9 series, compared to 3.8        Many new features for Python 3.9 are still being planned and written.  Among the new majornew features and changes so far:          PEP 584         , Union Operators in          dict          PEP 593         , Flexible function and variable annotations          PEP 602         , Python adopts a stable annual release cadence          BPO 38379         , garbage collection does not block on resurrected objects;          BPO 38692         , os.pidfd_open added that allows process management without races and signals;          BPO 39926         , Unicode support updated to version 13.0.0          BPO 1635741         , when Python is initialized multiple times in the same process, it does not leak memory anymore         A number of Python builtins (range, tuple, set, frozenset, list) are now sped up using          PEP 590         vectorcall          A number of standard library modules (audioop, ast, grp, _hashlib, pwd, _posixsubprocess, random, select, struct, termios, zlib) are now using the stable ABI defined by           PEP 384          .            fellow core developer,           if a feature you find important is missing from this list,            let \u0141ukasz know        The next pre-release, the last alpha release of Python 3.9, will be 3.9.0a6. It is currently scheduled for 2020-04-22.

As you might be aware, conferences are being cancelled worldwide. We still have hope, and before throwing the towel, we have decided to postpone. We took particular care to choose safe dates, far enough from the current outbreak peek estimates, but also far from the next fall/winter. Some experts state this is here to stay, and if they are correct, we should have troubles next fall/winter, let's just hope to a smaller degree.     Many of you have already bought tickets, and to those, we kindly ask to hope with us.     Ticket refunds will happen in any of the following scenarios:      Participant's inability to participate due to restrictions in place at the time or unavailability on the new dates.      Conference cancellation     Please do not rush requesting ticket refunds. We will process them as we can. Please note that a ticket refunded and latter on bought again has double the fees for us. So delay your decision for as long as you can. If everything goes well, we will have a conference, and we count on you to be there! When booking your trip to Porto for September, please make sure to book with the possibility to cancel.     For those of you who are planning or have already booked your flights with TAP, our official carrier,      here is some crucial information     . In short, they have plans for flight reschedules free of charge. You can reschedule your tickets to the new dates.     During the conference, we will follow the      World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines     , as well as the Portuguese Direc\u00e7\u00e3o Geral da Saude (DGS) guidelines.     Thank you for your understanding and patience during this uncertain time. We appreciate your support of this difficult decision and look forward to seeing you soon in September.

I've been informed that a solution does exist, but I'm not certain if there exists multiple solutions.            The problem is as following: A 9x9 grid of sudoku is completely empty. It does however contain             colored boxes            , and inside these boxes, the sum of the numbers has to be a             square number            . Other than that, normal             sudoku rules            apply.            The issue here is             not            solving a sudoku puzzle, but rather generating a viable puzzle, that satisfies the rules of the             colored boxes            .             My strategy            Using numpy arrays, I have divided the grid into 81 indices, which can be rearranged to a 9x9 grid. [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17] [18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26] [27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35] [36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44] [45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53] [54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62] [63 64 65 66 67 68 69 70 71]            Here is a list containing all the blocks of indices.            As you can see from the             picture            , or from the array above, the boxes are arranged into blocks of 2, 3, 4, or 5 (8 twos, 12 threes, 3 fours, 1 fiver). I've also noticed that a box can contain multiple numbers without breaking any rules of sudoku, but only 2 of one number is possible. Given that information, the biggest possible square would be 36, as 9+9+8+7+6 = 39, and thus no sum of a block could ever reach 49. To find out if the sum of a list contains a square number, I've made the following function:        return True        return False            To find out if a list contain the correct amount of duplicates, that is, more than one duplicate of only one number, I've made the following function:        if 3 in counter:            return False        return False    return True            Now, given the digits 1-9, there are limited ways solutions to a list, if the list has to sum into a square number. Using             itertools            , I could find the solutions, dividing them into an array, where index 0 contains blocks of twos, index 1 contains blocks of threes, and so on.            However, any permutation of these lists are viable solutions to the \"square problem\". Using             itertools            again, the total amount of possible boxes (without the sudoku rules) sums to 8782.           <pre class=\"lang-py prettyprint-override\"><code>from itertools import permutations    for item in solutions:        for arr in item:            for k in permutations(arr):    return s # 4-dimensional array, max 2 of each            This should be enough to implement functionality that decides if a board is legal, that is, rows, columns and boxes only contains one each of the digits 1-9. My implementation:                    return False                else:    return True             Difficulties with runtime            A straightforward approach would be to check every single combination of every single block. I have dones this, and produced several viable problems, however the complexity of my algorithm makes this take far too long time.            Instead, I tried to randomize some of the properties: The order of the blocks and the order of the solutions. Using this, I limited the number of tries, and checked if a solution was viable:correct = 0    score = 0    shapes = boxes    for block in shapes:        new_board = board        for sols in all_sols:                board = new_board                score+=1                break    #solve(board) # Using my solve function, not important here    # Note that without it, correct would always be 0 as the middle of the puzzle has no boxes    if 0 not in confirm:        print(correct)        possibleBoards.append(board)            In the code above, the variable score refers to how many blocks the algorithm could find during an attempt. The variable correct refers to how many of the generated sudoku boards could be completed. If you are interested in how well it did in 700 attempts, here are some             stats            (This is a historgram, the x-axis represents the scores, and the y-axis represents how many of each score was present during these 700 attempts).             What I need help with            I am struggling to find a feasible way to find a solution to this problem, that can actually run in a finite amount of time. I would greatly appreciate any tips regarding making some of my code faster or better, any ideas of a different approach to the problem, any solutions to the problem, or some useful tips about Python/Numpy relevant to this problem.             python             python-3.x             numpy             sudoku               share               |               improve this question               asked                Mar 18 at 2:50                balways                balways                 91                  4                 4 bronze badges                1                <code>                or so.

The neat property of this algorithm is that it doesn't require a \"traditional\" training phase. If you have a classification problem and labeled data you can predict the class of any unseen data point by leveraging your existing, already classified data.

The intuition        Imagine that we've invited 100 dog owners with their dogs over for a statistical experiment we want to run. Each dog participating in this experiment is 1 out of 4 different dog breeds we're interested in studying. While we have the dog owners and their dogs around we measure 3 different properties of each dog:         Its weight (in kilograms)         Its height (in centimeters)         Its alertness (on a scale from 0 to 1 [1=very alert, 0=almost no alertness])        Once done, we         normalize        After collection the data on each individual dog we end up with 100 3-pair measurements, each of which is labeled with the corresponding dog breed.        Here's one example:        In order to better understand the data it's always a good idea to plot it. Since we have collected 3 different measurements (weight, height and alterness) it's possible to project all of the 100 data points into a 3 dimensional space and color every data point according to its label (e.g. brown for the label \"         Podenco        Unfortuantely we run into an issue while attempting to plot this data. As it turns out we forgot to label one measurement. We do have the dogs width, its height and its alertness but for some reason we forgot to write down the dogs breed.        Is there any chance we could derive what this dogs breed might be given all the other dog measurements we already have? We can still add the unlabeled data point into our existing 3 dimensional space where all the other colored data points reside. But how should we color it?        One potential solution is to look at the, say 5 surrounding neighbors of the data point in question and see what their color is. If the majority of those data points is labeled \"Podenco\" then it's very likely that our measurements were also taken from a Podenco.        And that's exactly what the k-NN algorithm does. The         k-nearest neighbors algorithm        predicts the class of an unseen data point based on its k-nearest neighbors and the majority of their respective classes. Let's take a closer look at this from a mathematical perspective.        The 2 building blocks        There are only 2 concepts we need to implement in order to classify unseen data via k-NN.        As stated above, the algorithm works by looking at the k-         nearest neighbors        and the         majority of their respective classes        in order to classify unseen data.        Because of that we need to implement 2 functions. A distance function which calculates the distance between two points and a voting function which returns the most seen label given a list of arbitrary labels.        Distance function        Given the notion of \"nearest neighbors\" we need to calculate the distance between our \"to be classified\" data point and all the other data points to find the \\(k\\) closest ones.        There are a couple of different         distance functions        out there. For our implementation we'll use the         Euclidean distance        as it's simple to calculate and can easily scale up to \\(n\\) dimensions.        The mathematical notation is as follows:        Let's unpack this formula with the help of an example. Assuming we have two vectors \\(a\\) and \\(b\\), the euclidean distance between the two is calculated as follows:        Translating this into code results in the following:        Great. We just implemented the first building block: An Euclidean         distance        function.        Voting function        Next up we need to implement a voting function. The voting function takes as an input a list of labels and returns the \"most seen\" label of that list. While this sounds trivial to implement we should take a step back and think about potential edge cases we might run into.        One of those edge cases is the situation in which we have 2 or more \"most seen\" labels:        For those scenarios we need to implement a tie breaking mechanism.        There are several ways to deal with this. One solution might be to pick a candidate randomly. In our case however we shouldn't think about the vote function in isolation since we know that the distance and vote functions both work together to determine the label of the unseen data point.        We can exploit this fact and assume that the list of labels our vote function gets as an input is sorted by distance, nearest to furthest. Given this requirement it's easy to break ties. All we need to do is recursively remove the last entry in the list (which is the furthest) until we only have one clear winning label.        The following demonstrates this process based on the         labels        example from above:        Let's translate that algorithm into a function we call         majority_vote            break        max_num = num        The tests at the bottom show that our         majority_vote        function reliably deals with edge cases such as the one described above.        The k-NN algorithm        Now that we've studied and codified both building blocks it's time to bring them together. The         knn        function we're about to implement takes as inputs the list of labeled data points, a new measurement (the data point we want to classify) and a parameter         k        which determines how many neighbors we want to take into account when voting for the new label via our         majority_vote        function.        The first thing our         knn        algorithm should do is to calculate the distances between the new data point and all the other, existing data points. Once done we need to order the distances from nearest to furthest and extract the data point labels. This sorted list is then truncated so that it only contains the         k        nearest data point labels. The last step is to pass this list into the voting function which computes the predicted label.        Turning the described steps into code results in the following         knn        function:    class Distance(NamedTuple):        label: str        distance: float                                         for data in labeled_data]        That's it. That's the k-nearest neighbors algorithm implemented from scratch!        Classifying Iris flowers        It's time to see if our homebrew k-NN implementation works as advertised. To test drive what we've coded we'll use the infamous         Iris flower data set        The data set consists of 50 samples of three different flower species called Iris:          Iris Setosa          Iris Virginica          Iris Versicolor        For each sample, 4 different measurements were collected: The sepal width and length as well as its petal width and length.        The following is an example row from the data set where the first 4 numbers are the sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width and the last string represents the label for those measurements.        The best way to explore this data is to plot it. Unfortunately it's hard to plot and inspect 4 dimensional data. However we can pick 2 measurements (e.g. petal length and petal width) and scatter plot those in 2 dimensions.          Note        : We're using the amazing         Plotly        library to create our scatter plots.        We can clearly see clusters of data points which all share the same color and therefore the same label.        Now let's pretend that we have a new, unlabeled data point:        Adding this data point to our existing scatter plot results in the following:            text=\"The measurement we want to classify\")            showarrow=True,            arrowhead=7,            borderwidth=2,            borderpad=4,        Even if we're just plotting the petal length and petal width in 2 dimensions it seems to be the case that the new measurement might be coming from an \"Iris Versicolor\".        Let's use our         knn        function to get a definite answer:        And sure enough the result we get back indicates that we're dealing with an \"Iris Versicolor\":        Conclusion        k-nearest neighbors is a very powerful classification algorithm which makes it possible to label unseen data based on existing data. k-NNs main idea is to use the \\(k\\) nearest neighbors of the new, \"to-be-classified\" data point to \"vote\" on the label it should have.        Given that, we need 2 core functions to implement k-NN. The first function calculates the distance between 2 data points so that nearest neighbors can be found. The second function performs a majority vote so that a decision can be made as to what label is most present in the given neighborhood.        Using both functions together brings k-NN to life and makes it possible to reliably label unseen data points.        I hope that this post was helpful and demystified the inner workings of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

The distance reflects the total number of single-character edits required to transform one word into another. The more similar the two words are the less distance between them, and vice versa. One common use for this distance is in the autocompletion or autocorrection features of text processors or chat applications.         Previously we discussed          how the Levenshtein distance works         , and we considered several examples using the dynamic programming approach.         In this tutorial the Levenshtein distance will be implemented in Python using the dynamic programming approach. We'll create a simple application with autocomplete and autocorrect features which use the Levenshtein distance to select the \"closest\" words in the dictionary.         The sections covered in this tutorial are as follows:          Creating the           distances          matrix          Initializing the           distances          matrix          Printing the           distances          matrix          Calculating distances between all prefixes          Dictionary search for autocompletion/autocorrection         Let's get started.            Bring this project to life            Run on gradient          Creating The Distance Matrix         Using the dynamic programming approach for calculating the Levenshtein distance, a 2-D matrix is created that holds the distances between all prefixes of the two words being compared (we saw this in          Part 1         ). Thus, the first thing to do is to create this 2-D matrix.         We are going to create a function named          levenshteinDistanceDP()         that accepts 2 arguments named          token1         and          token2         , representing the two words. It returns an integer representing the distance between them. The header of this function is as follows:         Given two words of lengths          m         and          n         , and based on the steps discussed in the previous tutorial, the first thing to do is to create a 2-D matrix of integers of size         or         based on whether the first word represents the rows or the columns. It doesn't matter which word is used for what, but you do need to be consistent since the rest of the code depends on this choice.         The next line creates such a matrix in a variable named          distances         (in this case the first word represents the rows and the second word represents the columns). Note that the length of the string is returned using the         function.          Initializing The Distance Matrix         The next step is to initialize the first row and column of the matrix with integers starting from          0         . We'll do that with the          for         loop shown below, which uses a variable named          t1         (shortcut for          token1         ) that starts from 0 and ends at the length of the second word. Note that the          row index         is fixed to          0         and the variable          t1         is used to define the          column index         . By doing that, the first row is filled with values starting from          0         For initializing the first column of the          distances         matrix another          for         loop is used, as given below. There are two changes compared to the previous loop. The first is that the loop variable is named          t2         rather than          t1         to reflect that it starts from          0         until the end of the argument          token2         . The second change is that the column index of the          distances         array is now fixed to          0         , while the loop variable          t2         is used to define the index of the rows. This way the first column is initialized by values starting from          0          Printing The Distance Matrix         After initializing both the first row and first column of the          distances         array, we'll use a function named          printDistances()         to print its contents using two          for         loops. It accepts three arguments:           distances          : The 2-D matrix holding the distances.           token1Length          : Length of the first word.           token2Length          : Length of the second word.        for t2 in range(token2Length + 1):         Below is the complete implementation up to this point. The          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function is called after passing the words          kelm         and          hello         , which were used in the previous tutorial. Since we're not done yet, it will currently return          0def levenshteinDistanceDP(token1, token2):            return 0def printDistances(distances, token1Length, token2Length):        for t2 in range(token2Length + 1):                 Inside the          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function, the          printDistances()         function is called for printing the          distances         array according to the next line.         Here is the output.1 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0          Up to this point, the          distances         matrix is successfully initialized. In the next section we'll calculate the distances between all prefixes of the two words.          Calculating Distances Between All Prefixes         To calculate the distances between all prefixes of the two words, two          for         loops are used to iterate through each cell in the matrix (excluding the first row/column).         Inside the loops the distances are calculated for all combinations of prefixes from the two words. Based on the discussion in the previous tutorial, the distance between two prefixes is calculated based on a          2 x 2         matrix as shown in the next figure. Such a matrix always has three known values and just one missing value which is to be calculated.         If the two characters located at the end of the two prefixes being compared are equal, then the distance is equal to the value in the top-left corner of the          2 x 2         matrix. This is implemented in the next          if         statement.         If the two characters are not equal, then the distance in the current cell is equal to the minimum of the three existing values in the          2 x 2         matrix after adding a cost of          1         . An          else         block is added to the previous          if         statement to calculate such a distance according to the following code.                         Here are the two          for         loops after adding this          if-else         block.        else:        else:         At this moment, the          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function is almost complete except for returning the calculated distance between the two words. This distance is located at the bottom-right corner of the          distances         matrix and is returned according to this line.         The implementation of the          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function is now 100% complete. Here's the full code.                        else:                                else:         The next line calls the          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function to print the          distances         matrix and return the final distance between the two words.         The output should look like that shown below.1 1 2 3 4 5 2 2 1 2 3 4 3 3 2 1 2 3 4 4 3 2 2 3          The distance between \"kelm\" and \"hello\" is 3.         In the next section we'll build on top of this function to allow the user to enter a word, and the top closest words (based on a dictionary search) will be returned.          Dictionary Search for Word Autocompletion and Autocorrection         One application of the Levenshtein distance is to help the writer write faster by automatically correcting typos or completing words. In this section we'll experiment with a small version of the English dictionary (which contains just 1,000 common words) to complete this task. The dictionary is available for download at          this link         . It is a text file from which we will read and extract each word, then call the          levenshteinDistanceDP()         function, and finally return the best-matched words. Of course, you could always expand this implementation with a full-sized dictionary of your choosing.         The block of code below creates a function named          calcDictDistance()         which accepts two arguments, reads the dictionary, and calculates the distance between the search word and all words in the dictionary.         The first argument is named          word         and represents the search word to be compared by the words in the dictionary. The second argument is named          numWords         which accepts the number of matched words to be filtered.         Currently, the          calcDictDistance()         function just reads the text file at the specified path using the         function. The variable          line         iteratively holds each line (i.e. word) in the dictionary returned using the          readLines()         method. The          calcDictDistance()         function does not yet return anything, but we will soon change it to return a list holding the best-matched words.          for line in lines:          Next is to compare the search word with each word in the dictionary, calculate a distance, and store all distances in a list named          dictWordDist         . Its length is 1,000 because the dictionary contains 1,000 words.         The          dictWordDist         list is of type          String         and holds both the distance and the dictionary word separated by          -         . For example, if the distance between the search word and the word \"follow\" is two, then the entry saved in the          dictWordDist         list will be          2-follow         . Later, the distance will be separated from the word using the         method.    wordIdx = 0        for line in lines:             wordDistance = 9         The function is now ready for filtering the          dictWordDist         list for returning the best-matched words based on the distance. The complete function is shown below. A list named          closestWords         is defined to hold the best-matched words. Its length is set to the value inside the          numWords         argument.         The          dictWordDist         list is sorted to leave the best-matched words at the top of the list. Inside a          for         loop with a number of iterations equal to the value of the          numWords         argument, the          dictWordDist         list is indexed to return a string holding the distance and the word separated by          -    wordIdx = 0        for line in lines:             wordDistance = 9        wordIdx = wordIdx + 1    currWordDist = 0    print(dictWordDist)        currWordDist = dictWordDist[i]         This string is then split using the         method which returns a list with two elements: the first is the distance, and the second is the word. The word is inserted into the          closestWords         list which is then returned by the          calcDictDistance()         function. Now this function is considered complete.         Here is an example of calling the          calcDictDistance()         function. The search word is          pape         and the number of matches is          3         The output of the above code is given below. The Levenshtein distance successfully helped in making good suggestions, especially for the first two words. By doing that, the user does not have to enter the complete word and by just entering some characters that discriminate the word, the program is able to make suggestions that help in either autocompletion or autocorrection.paper           Add speed and simplicity to your Machine Learning workflow today          Get started          Contact Sales          Conclusion         This tutorial discussed the Python implementation of the Levenshtein distance using the dynamic programming approach. We started by creating a function named          levenshteinDistanceDP()         in which a 2-D distance matrix is created for holding the distances between all prefixes of two words. This function accepts the two words as input, and returns a number representing the distance between them.         Another function named          calcDictDistance()         is created to build a useful application of the Levenshtein distance in which the user supplies a word and the program returns the best-matched words based on a dictionary search. This helps in autocompleting or autocorrecting text while a user is typing.

Mathematical calculations are an essential part of most Python development. Whether you\u2019re working on a scientific project, a financial application, or any other type of programming endeavor, you just can\u2019t escape the need for math.       For straightforward mathematical calculations in Python, you can use the built-in mathematical        operators       , such as addition (       ). But more advanced operations, such as exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric, or power functions, are not built in. Does that mean you need to implement all of these functions from scratch?       Fortunately, no. Python provides a        module       specifically designed for higher-level mathematical operations: the        math       module.        By the end of this article, you\u2019ll learn:        What the Python         math        module is        How to use         math        module functions to solve real-life problems        What the constants of the         math        module are, including pi, tau, and Euler\u2019s number        What the differences between built-in functions and         math        functions are        What the differences between         math         cmath        , and NumPy are       A background in mathematics will be helpful here, but don\u2019t worry if math isn\u2019t your strong suit. This article will explain the basics of everything you need to know.       So let\u2019s get started!

Remove ads       Getting to Know the Python        math       Module       The        Python         math        module       is an important feature designed to deal with mathematical operations. It comes packaged with the standard Python release and has been there from the beginning. Most of the        math       module\u2019s functions are thin wrappers around the C platform\u2019s mathematical functions. Since its underlying functions are written in        CPython       , the        math       module is efficient and conforms to the        C standard       The Python        math       module offers you the ability to perform common and useful mathematical calculations within your application. Here are a few practical uses for the        math       module:        Calculating combinations and permutations using factorials        Calculating the height of a pole using trigonometric functions        Calculating radioactive decay using the exponential function        Calculating the curve of a suspension bridge using hyperbolic functions        Solving quadratic equations        Simulating periodic functions, such as sound and light waves, using trigonometric functions       Since the        math       module comes packaged with the Python release, you don\u2019t have to install it separately. Using it is just a matter of        importing the module       You can import the Python        math       module using the above command. After importing, you can use it straightaway.       Constants of the        math       Module       The Python        math       module offers a variety of predefined        constants       . Having access to these constants provides several advantages. For one, you don\u2019t have to manually hardcode them into your application, which saves you a lot of time. Plus, they provide consistency throughout your code. The module includes several famous mathematical constants and important values:        Pi        Tau        Euler\u2019s number        Infinity        Not a number (NaN)       In this section, you\u2019ll learn about the constants and how to use them in your Python code.       Pi       Pi (\u03c0) is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference (        c       ) to its diameter (        d       This ratio is always the same for any circle.       Pi is an        irrational number       , which means it can\u2019t be expressed as a simple fraction. Therefore, pi has an infinite number of decimal places, but it can be approximated as 22/7, or 3.141.         Interesting Fact:        Pi is the most recognized and well-known mathematical constant in the world. It has its own celebration date, called         Pi Day       You can access pi as follows:       As you can see, the pi value is given to fifteen decimal places in Python. The number of digits provided depends on the underlying C compiler. Python prints the first fifteen digits by default, and        math.pi       always returns a float value.       So what are some of the ways that pi can be useful to you? You can calculate the circumference of a circle using 2\u03c0        r       , where        r       is the radius of the circle:       You can use        math.pi       to calculate the circumference of a circle. You can also calculate the area of a circle using the formula \u03c0        r       \u00b2 as follows:       You can use        math.pi       to calculate the area and the circumference of a circle. When you are doing mathematical calculations with Python and you come across a formula that uses \u03c0, it\u2019s a best practice to use the pi value given by the        math       module instead of hardcoding the value.        Remove ads       Tau       Tau (\u03c4) is the ratio of a circle\u2019s circumference to its radius. This constant is equal to 2\u03c0, or roughly 6.28. Like pi, tau is an irrational number because it\u2019s just pi times two.       Many mathematical expressions use 2\u03c0, and using tau instead can help simplify your equations. For example, instead of calculating the circumference of a circle with 2\u03c0        r       , we can substitute tau and use the simpler equation \u03c4        r       The use of tau as the circle constant, however, is still under        debate       . You have the freedom to use either 2\u03c0 or \u03c4 as necessary.       You can use tau as below:       Like        math.pi        math.tau       returns fifteen digits and is a float value. You can use tau to calculate the circumference of a circle with \u03c4        r       , where        r       is the radius, as follows:       You can use        math.tau       in place of       to tidy up equations that include the expression 2\u03c0.       Euler\u2019s Number       Euler\u2019s number (        e       ) is a constant that is the base of the        natural logarithm       , a mathematical function that is commonly used to calculate rates of growth or decay. As with pi and tau, Euler\u2019s number is an irrational number with infinite decimal places. The value of        e       is often approximated as 2.718.       Euler\u2019s number is an important constant because it has many practical uses, such as calculating population growth over time or determining rates of radioactive decay. You can access Euler\u2019s number from the        math       module as follows:       As with        math.pi       and        math.tau       , the value of        math.e       is given to fifteen decimal places and is returned as a float value.       Infinity       Infinity can\u2019t be defined by a number. Rather, it\u2019s a mathematical concept representing something that is never-ending or boundless. Infinity can go in either direction, positive or negative.       You can use infinity in        algorithms       when you want to compare a given value to an absolute maximum or minimum value. The values of positive and negative infinity in Python are as follows:       Infinity is not a numerical value. Instead, it\u2019s defined as        math.inf       . Python introduced this constant in version 3.5 as an equivalent to       Both       and        math.inf       represent the concept of infinity, making        math.inf       greater than any numerical value:       In the above code,        math.inf       is greater than the value of        x       , 10        308       (the maximum size of a floating-point number), which is a double precision number.       Similarly,       is smaller than any value:       Negative infinity is smaller than the value of        y       , which is -10        308       . No number can be greater than infinity or smaller than negative infinity. That\u2019s why mathematical operations with        math.inf       don\u2019t change the value of infinity:       As you can see, neither addition nor division changes the value of        math.inf        Remove ads       Not a Number (NaN)       Not a number, or NaN, isn\u2019t really a mathematical concept. It originated in the computer science field as a reference to values that are not numeric. A NaN value can be due to invalid inputs, or it can indicate that a variable that        should       be numerical has been corrupted by text characters or symbols.       It\u2019s always a best practice to check if a value is NaN. If it is, then it could lead to invalid values in your program. Python introduced the NaN constant in version 3.5.       You can observe the value of        math.nan       below:       NaN is not a numerical value. You can see that the value of        math.nan       is        nan       , the same value as       Arithmetic Functions        Number theory       is a branch of pure mathematics, which is the study of natural numbers. Number theory usually deals with positive whole numbers or integers.       The Python        math       module provides functions that are useful in number theory as well as in        representation theory       , a related field. These functions allow you to calculate a range of important values, including the following:        The         factorials        of a number        The         greatest common divisor        of two numbers        The sum of         iterables       Find Factorials With Python       You may have seen mathematical expressions like 7! or 4! before. The exclamation marks don\u2019t mean that the numbers are excited. Rather, \u201c!\u201d is the        factorial       symbol. Factorials are used in finding permutations or combinations. You can determine the factorial of a number by multiplying all whole numbers from the chosen number down to 1.       The following table shows the factorial values for 4, 6, and 7:           Symbol           In Words           Expression           Result           4!           Four factorial           4 x 3 x 2 x 1           24           6!           Six factorial           6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1           720           7!           Seven factorial           7 x 6 x 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1           5040       You can see from the table that 4!, or four factorial, gives the value 24 by multiplying the range of whole numbers from 4 to 1. Similarly, 6! and 7! give the values 720 and 5040, respectively.       You can implement a factorial function in Python using one of several tools:         for        loops        Recursive functions       First you are going to look at a factorial implementation using a         for        loop       . This is a relatively straightforward approach:       You can also use a        recursive function       to find the factorial. This is more complicated but also more elegant than using a        for       loop. You can implement the recursive function as follows:         Note:        There is a limit to the         recursion depth        in Python, but that subject is outside the scope of this article.       The following example illustrates how you can use the        for       loop and recursive functions:       Even though their implementations are different, their return values are the same.       However, implementing functions of your own just to get the factorial of a number is time consuming and inefficient. A better method is to use       . Here\u2019s how you can find the factorial of a number using       This approach returns the desired output with a minimal amount of code.       accepts only positive integer values. If you try to input a negative value, then you will get a        ValueError       Inputting a negative value will result in a        ValueError       reading        factorial() not defined for negative values       doesn\u2019t accept decimal numbers, either. It will give you a        ValueError       Inputting a decimal value results in a        ValueError       reading        factorial() only accepts integral values       You can compare the execution times for each of the factorial methods using       The sample above illustrates the results of       for each of the three factorial methods.       executes one million loops each time it is run. The following table compares the execution times of the three factorial methods:           Type           Execution Time           With loops           1.0640 s           With recursion           1.8153 s           With            factorial()           0.1067 s       As you can see from the execution times,       is faster than the other methods. That\u2019s because of its underlying C implementation. The recursion-based method is the slowest out of the three. Although you might get different timings depending on your        CPU       , the order of the functions should be the same.       Not only is       faster than the other methods, but it\u2019s also more stable. When you implement your own function, you have to explicitly code for        disaster cases       such as handling negative or decimal numbers. One mistake in the implementation could lead to bugs. But when using       , you don\u2019t have to worry about disaster cases because the function handles them all. Therefore, it\u2019s a best practice to use       whenever possible.        Remove ads       Find the Ceiling Value With       will return the smallest integer value that is greater than or equal to the given number. If the number is a positive or negative decimal, then the function will return the next integer value greater than the given value.       For example, an input of 5.43 will return the value 6, and an input of -12.43 will return the value -12.       can take positive or negative real numbers as input values and will always return an integer value.       When you input an integer value to       , it will return the same number:       always returns the same value when an integer is given as input. To see the true nature of       , you have to input decimal values:       When the value is positive (4.23), the function returns the next integer greater than the value (5). When the value is negative (-11.453), the function likewise returns the next integer greater than the value (-11).       The function will return a        TypeError       if you input a value that is not a number:       You must input a number to the function. If you try to input any other value, then you will get a        TypeError       Find the Floor Value With       will return the closest integer value that is less than or equal to the given number. This function behaves opposite to       . For example, an input of 8.72 will return 8, and an input of -12.34 will return -13.       can take either positive or negative numbers as input and will return an integer value.       If you input an integer value, then the function will return the same value:       As with       , when the input for       is an integer, the result will be the same as the input number. The output only differs from the input when you input decimal values:       When you input a positive decimal value (5.532), it will return the closest integer that is less than the input number (5). If you input a negative number (-6.432), then it will return the next lowest integer value (-7).       If you try to input a value that is not a number, then the function will return a        TypeError       You can\u2019t give non-number values as input to       . Doing so will result in a        TypeError        Remove ads       Truncate Numbers With       When you get a number with a decimal point, you might want to keep only the integer part and eliminate the decimal part. The        math       module has a function called       which lets you do just that.       Dropping the decimal value is a type of        rounding       . With       , negative numbers are always rounded upward toward zero and positive numbers are always rounded downward toward zero.       Here is how the       function rounds off positive or negative numbers:       As you can see, 12.32 is rounded downwards towards 0, which gives the result 12. In the same way, -43.24 is rounded upwards towards 0, which gives the value -43.       always rounds towards zero regardless of whether the number is positive or negative.       When dealing with positive numbers,       behaves the same as       behaves the same as       for positive numbers. As you can see, the return value of both functions is the same.       When dealing with negative numbers,       behaves the same as       When the number is negative,       behaves the same as       . The return values of both functions are the same.       Find the Closeness of Numbers With Python       In certain situations\u2014particularly in the data science field\u2014you may need to determine whether two numbers are close to each other. But to do so, you first need to answer an important question: How        close       is        close       ? In other words, what is the definition of close?       Well,        Merriam-Webster       will tell you that close means \u201cnear in time, space, effect, or degree.\u201d Not very helpful, is it?       For example, take the following set of numbers: 2.32, 2.33, and 2.331. When you measure closeness by two decimal points, 2.32 and 2.33 are close. But in reality, 2.33 and 2.331 are closer. Closeness, therefore, is a relative concept. You can\u2019t determine closeness without some kind of threshold.       Fortunately, the        math       module provides a function called       that lets you set your own threshold, or        tolerance       , for closeness. It returns        True       if two numbers are within your established tolerance for closeness and otherwise returns        False       Let\u2019s check out how to compare two numbers using the default tolerances:         Relative tolerance        , or         rel_tol        , is the maximum difference for being considered \u201cclose\u201d relative to the magnitude of the input values. This is the percentage of tolerance. The default value is 1e-09 or 0.000000001.         Absolute tolerance        , or         abs_tol        , is the maximum difference for being considered \u201cclose\u201d regardless of the magnitude of the input values. The default value is 0.0.       will return        True       when the following condition is satisfied:        isclose       uses the above expression to determine the closeness of two numbers. You can substitute your own values and observe whether any two numbers are close.       In the following case, 6 and 7        aren\u2019t       close:       The numbers 6 and 7 aren\u2019t considered close because the relative tolerance is set for nine decimal places. But if you input 6.999999999 and 7 under the same tolerance, then they        are       considered close:       You can see that the value 6.999999999 is within nine decimal places of 7. Therefore, based on the default relative tolerance, 6.999999999 and 7 are considered close.       You can adjust the relative tolerance however you want depending on your need. If you set        rel_tol       to 0.2, then 6 and 7 are considered close:       You can observe that 6 and 7 are close now. This is because they are within 20% of each other.       As with        rel_tol       , you can adjust the        abs_tol       value according to your needs. To be considered close, the difference between the input values must be less than or equal to the absolute tolerance value. You can set the        abs_tol       as follows:       When you set the absolute tolerance to 1, the numbers 6 and 7 are close because the difference between them is equal to the absolute tolerance. However, in the second case, the difference between 6 and 7 is not less than or equal to the established absolute tolerance of 0.2.       You can use the        abs_tol       for very small values:       As you can see, you can determine the closeness of very small numbers with        isclose       . A few special cases regarding closeness can be illustrated using        nan       and        inf       values:       You can see from the above examples that        nan       is not close to any value, not even to itself. On the other hand,        inf       is not close to any numerical values, not even to very large ones, but it        is       close to itself.        Remove ads       Power Functions       The power function takes any number        x       as input, raises        x       to some power        n       , and returns        x         n       as output. Python\u2019s        math       module provides several power-related functions. In this section, you\u2019ll learn about power functions, exponential functions, and square root functions.       Calculate the Power of a Number With       Power functions have the following formula where the variable         x        is the base       , the variable         n        is the power       , and         a        can be any constant        Power Function       In the formula above, the value of the base        x       is raised to the power of        n       You can use       to get the power of a number. There is a built-in function,       , that is different from       . You will learn the difference later in this section.       takes two parameters as follows:       The first argument is the base value and the second argument is the power value. You can give an integer or a decimal value as input and the function always returns a float value. There are some special cases defined in       When the base 1 is raised to the power of any number n, it gives the result 1.0:       When you raise base value 1 to any power value, you will always get 1.0 as the result. Likewise, any base number raised to the power of 0 gives the result 1.0:       As you can see, any number raised to the power of 0 will give 1.0 as the result. You can see that result even if the base is        nan       Zero raised to the power of any positive number will give 0.0 as the result:       But if you try to raise 0.0 to a negative power, then the result will be a        ValueError       The        ValueError       only occurs when the base is 0. If the base is any other number except 0, then the function will return a valid power value.       Apart from       , there are two built-in ways of finding the power of a number in Python:       The first option is straightforward. You may have used it a time or two already. The return type of the value is determined by the inputs:       When you use integers, you get an integer value. When you use decimal values, the return type changes to a decimal value.       The second option is a versatile built-in function. You don\u2019t have to use any imports to use it. The built-in       method has three parameters:        The         base        number        The         power        number        The         modulus        number       The first two parameters are mandatory, whereas the third parameter is optional. You can input integers or decimal numbers and the function will return the appropriate result based on the input:       The built-in       has two required arguments that work the same as the base and power in the       syntax. The       method also has a third parameter that is optional:        modulus       . This parameter is often used in        cryptography       with the optional modulus parameter is equivalent to the equation       . The Python syntax looks like this:       raises the base (32) to the power (6), and then the result value is        modulo divided       by the modulus number (5). In this case, the result is 4. You can substitute your own values and see that both       and the given equation provide the same results.       Even though all three methods of calculating power do the same thing, there are some implementation differences between them. The execution times for each method are as follows:       The following table compares the execution times of the three methods as measured by           Type           Execution Time           1.0079 s           1.0476 s           0.1837 s       You can observe from the table that       is faster than the other methods and built-in       is the slowest.       The reason behind the efficiency of       is the way that it\u2019s implemented. It relies on the underlying C language. On the other hand,       and       use the input object\u2019s own implementation of the       operator. However,       can\u2019t handle complex numbers (which will be explained in a later section), whereas       and       can.        Remove ads       Find the Natural Exponent With       You learned about power functions in the previous section. With exponential functions, things are a bit different. Instead of the base being the variable, power becomes the variable. It looks something like this:        General Exponential Function       Here        a       can be any constant, and        x       , which is the power value, becomes the variable.       So what\u2019s so special about exponential functions? The value of the function grows rapidly as the        x       value increases. If the base is greater than 1, then the function continuously increases in value as        x       increases. A special property of exponential functions is that the slope of the function also continuously increases as        x       increases.       You learned about the Euler\u2019s number        in a previous section       . It is the base of the natural logarithm. It also plays a role with the exponential function. When Euler\u2019s number is incorporated into the exponential function, it becomes the        natural exponential function        Natural Exponential Function       This function is used in many real-life situations. You may have heard of the term        exponential growth       , which is often used in relation to human population growth or rates of radioactive decay. Both of these can be calculated using the natural exponential function.       The Python        math       module provides a function,       , that lets you calculate the natural exponent of a number. You can find the value as follows:       The input number can be positive or negative, and the function always returns a float value. If the number is not a numerical value, then the method will return a        TypeError       As you can see, if the input is a string value, then the function returns a        TypeError       reading        must be real number, not str       You can also calculate the exponent using the       expression or by using       . The execution times of these three methods are as follows:       The following table compares the execution times of the above methods as measured by           Type           Execution Time           0.1785 s           0.2104 s           0.1259 s       You can see that       is faster than the other methods and       is the slowest. This is the expected behavior because of the underlying C implementation of the        math       module.       It\u2019s also worth noting that       and       return the same values, but       returns a slightly different value. This is due to implementation differences. Python documentation notes that       is more accurate than the other two methods.       Practical Example With        Radioactive decay       happens when an unstable atom loses energy by emitting ionizing radiation. The rate of radioactive decay is measured using half-life, which is the time it takes for half the amount of the parent nucleus to decay. You can calculate the decay process using the following formula:        Radioactive Decay Equation       You can use the above formula to calculate the remaining quantity of a radioactive element after a certain number of years. The variables of the given formula are as follows:        is the initial quantity of the substance.        is the quantity that still remains and has not yet decayed after a time (         t          T        is the half-life of the decaying quantity.          e        is Euler\u2019s number.       Scientific research has identified the half-lives of all radioactive elements. You can substitute values to the equation to calculate the remaining quantity of any radioactive substance. Let\u2019s try that now.       The radioisotope strontium-90 has a half-life of 38.1 years. A sample contains 100 mg of Sr-90. You can calculate the remaining milligrams of Sr-90 after 100 years:       As you can see, the half-life is set to 38.1 and the duration is set to 100 years. You can use        math.exp       to simplify the equation. By substituting the values to the equation you can find that, after 100 years,        16.22mg       of Sr-90 remains.        Remove ads       Logarithmic Functions        Logarithmic functions       can be considered the inverse of exponential functions. They are denoted in the following form:        General Logarithmic Function       Here        a       is the base of the logarithm, which can be any number. You learned about exponential functions in a previous section. Exponential functions can be expressed in the form of logarithmic functions and vice versa.       Python Natural Log With       The        natural logarithm       of a number is its logarithm to the base of the mathematical constant        e       , or Euler\u2019s number:        Natural Logarithmic Function       As with the exponential function, natural log uses the constant        e        e       is implicit.       You can use the natural log in the same way that you use the exponential function. It\u2019s used to calculate values such as the rate of population growth or the rate of radioactive decay in elements.       has two arguments. The first one is mandatory and the second one is optional. With one argument you can get the natural log (to the base        e       ) of the input number:       However, the function returns a        ValueError       if you input a non-positive number:       As you can see, you can\u2019t input a negative value to       . This is because log values are undefined for negative numbers and zero.       With two arguments, you can calculate the log of the first argument to the base of the second argument:       You can see how the value changes when the log base is changed.       Understand       and       The Python        math       module also provides two separate functions that let you calculate the log values to the base of 2 and 10:        is used to calculate the log value to the base 2.        is used to calculate the log value to the base 10.       With       you can get the log value to the base 2:       Both functions have the same objective, but the        Python documentation       notes that       is more accurate than using       You can calculate the log value of a number to base 10 with       The        Python documentation       also mentions that       is more accurate than       even though both functions have the same objective.        Remove ads       Practical Example With Natural Log       In a        previous section       , you saw how to use       to calculate the remaining amount of a radioactive element after a certain period of time. With       , you can find the half-life of an unknown radioactive element by measuring the mass at an interval. The following equation can be used to calculate the half-life of a radioactive element:        Radioactive Decay Equation       By rearranging the radioactive decay formula, you can make the half-life (        T       ) the subject of the formula. The variables of the given formula are as follows:          T        is the half-life of the decaying quantity.        is the initial quantity of the substance.        is the quantity that remains and has not yet decayed after a period of time (         t         ln        is the natural log.       You can substitute the known values to the equation to calculate the half-life of a radioactive substance.       For example, imagine you are studying an unidentified radioactive element sample. When it was discovered 100 years ago, the sample size was 100mg. After 100 years of decay, only 16.22mg is remaining. Using the formula above, you can calculate the half-life of this unknown element:       You can see that the unknown element has a half-life of roughly 38.1 years. Based on this information, you can identify the unknown element as strontium-90.       Other Important        math       Module Functions       The Python        math       module has many useful functions for mathematical calculations, and this article only covered a few of them in depth. In this section, you will briefly learn about some of the other important functions available in the        math       module.       Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor       The        greatest common divisor (GCD)       of two positive numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without a remainder.       For example, the GCD of 15 and 25 is 5. You can divide both 15 and 25 by 5 without any remainder. There is no greater number that does the same. If you take 15 and 30, then the GCD is 15 because both 15 and 30 can be divided by 15 without a remainder.       You don\u2019t have to implement your own functions to calculate GCD. The Python        math       module provides a function called       that allows you to calculate the GCD of two numbers. You can give positive or negative numbers as input, and it returns the appropriate GCD value. You can\u2019t input a decimal number, however.       Calculate the Sum of Iterables       If you ever want to find the sum of the values of an iterable without using a loop, then       is probably the easiest way to do so. You can use iterables such as arrays,        tuples, or lists       as input and the function returns the sum of the values. A built-in function called       lets you calculate the sum of iterables as well, but       is more accurate than       . You can read more about that in the        documentation       Calculate the Square Root       The        square root       of a number is a value that, when multiplied by itself, gives the number. You can use       to find the square root of any positive real number (integer or decimal). The return value is always a float value. The function will throw a        ValueError       if you try to enter a negative number.       Convert Angle Values       In real-life scenarios as well as in mathematics, you often come across instances where you have to measure angles to perform calculations. Angles can be measured either by degrees or by radians. Sometimes you have to convert degrees to radians and vice versa. The        math       module provides functions that let you do so.       If you want to convert degrees to radians, then you can use       . It returns the radian value of the degree input. Likewise, if you want to convert radians to degrees, then you can use        Remove ads       Calculate Trigonometric Values       Trigonometry is the study of triangles. It deals with the relationship between angles and the sides of a triangle. Trigonometry is mostly interested in right-angled triangles (in which one internal angle is 90 degrees), but it can also be applied to other types of triangles. The Python        math       module provides very useful functions that let you perform trigonometric calculations.       You can calculate the sine value of an angle with       , the cosine value with       , and the tangent value with       . The        math       module also provides functions to calculate arc sine with       , arc cosine with       , and arc tangent with       . Finally, you can calculate the hypotenuse of a triangle using       New Additions to the        math       Module in Python 3.8       With the release of        Python version 3.8       , a few new additions and changes have been made to the        math       module. The new additions and changes are as follows:         returns the number of ways to choose          k         items from          n         items without repetition and          without particular order         returns the number of ways to choose          k         items from          n         items without repetition and          with order         returns the integer square root of a non-negative integer.         calculates the product of all of the elements in the input iterable. As with         , this method can take iterables such as arrays, lists, or tuples.         returns the          Euclidean distance         between two points          p         and          q         , each given as a sequence (or iterable) of coordinates. The two points must have the same dimension.         now handles more than two dimensions. Previously, it supported a maximum of two dimensions.        cmath       vs        math       A        complex number       is a combination of a real number and an imaginary number. It has the formula of        a + bi       , where        a       is the real number and        bi       is the imaginary number. Real and imaginary numbers can be explained as follows:        A         real number        is literally any number you can think of.        An         imaginary number        is a number that gives a negative result when squared.       A real number can be any number. For example, 12, 4.3, -19.0 are all real numbers. Imaginary numbers are shown as        i       . The following image shows an example of a complex number:        Complex Number       In the example above,        7       is the real number and        3i       is the imaginary number. Complex numbers are mostly used in geometry, calculus, scientific calculations, and especially in electronics.       The functions of the Python        math       module aren\u2019t equipped to handle complex numbers. However, Python provides a different module that can specifically deal with complex numbers, the        cmath       module. The Python        math       module is complemented by the        cmath       module, which implements many of the same functions but for complex numbers.       You can import the        cmath       module as follows:       Since the        cmath       module is also packaged with Python, you can import it the same way you imported the        math       module. Before you work with the        cmath       module, you have to know how to define a complex number. You can define a complex number as follows:       As you can see, you can determine that a number is indeed complex by using         Note:        In mathematics, the imaginary unit is usually denoted         i        . In some fields, it\u2019s more customary to use         j        for the same thing. In Python, you use         j        to denote imaginary numbers.       Python also provides a special built-in function called       that lets you create complex numbers. You can use       as follows:       You can use either method to create complex numbers. You can also use the        cmath       module to calculate mathematical functions for complex numbers as follows:       This example shows you how to calculate the square root, logarithmic value, and exponential value of a complex number. You can read the        documentation       if you want to learn more about the        cmath       module.       NumPy vs        math       Several notable Python libraries can be used for mathematical calculations. One of the most prominent libraries is Numerical Python, or        NumPy       . It is mainly used in scientific computing and in data science fields. Unlike the        math       module, which is part of the standard Python release, you have to install NumPy in order to work with it.       The heart of NumPy is the high-performance        N       -dimensional (multidimensional) array data structure. This array allows you to perform mathematical operations on an entire array        without looping over the elements       . All of the functions in the library are optimized to work with the N-dimensional array objects.       Both the        math       module and the NumPy library can be used for mathematical calculations. NumPy has several similarities with the        math       module. NumPy has a subset of        functions       , similar to        math       module functions, that deal with mathematical calculations. Both NumPy and        math       provide functions that deal with        trigonometric        exponential        logarithmic        hyperbolic       and        arithmetic       calculations.       There are also several fundamental differences between        math       and NumPy. The Python        math       module is geared more towards working with scalar values, whereas NumPy is better suited for working with arrays, vectors, and even matrices.       When working with scalar values,        math       module functions can be faster than their NumPy counterparts. This is because the NumPy functions convert the values to arrays under the hood in order to perform calculations on them. NumPy is much faster when working with        N       -dimensional arrays because of the optimizations for them. Except for       and       , the        math       module functions can\u2019t handle arrays.       Conclusion       In this article, you learned about the Python        math       module. The module provides useful functions for performing mathematical calculations that have many practical applications.        In this article you\u2019ve learned:        What the Python         math        module is        How to use         math        functions with practical examples        What the constants of the         math        module, including pi, tau, and Euler\u2019s number are        What the differences between built-in functions and         math        functions are        What the differences between         math         cmath        , and NumPy are       Understanding how to use the        math       functions is the first step.

A rewrite checklist         So, what did we build?         Over the past four years, we've been working hard on rebuilding our desktop client's sync engine from scratch. The sync engine is the magic behind the Dropbox folder on your desktop computer, and it's one of the oldest and most important pieces of code at Dropbox. We're proud to announce today that we've shipped this new sync engine (codenamed \"Nucleus\") to all Dropbox users.         Rewriting the sync engine was really hard, and we don\u2019t want to blindly celebrate it, because in many environments it would have been a terrible idea. It turned out that this was an excellent idea for Dropbox but only because we were very thoughtful about how we went about this process. In particular, we\u2019re going to share reflections on how to think about a major software rewrite and highlight the key initiatives that made this project a success, like having a very clean data model.         To begin, let's rewind the clock to 2008, the year          Dropbox sync first entered beta         . At first glance, a lot of Dropbox sync looks the same as today. The user installs the Dropbox app, which creates a magic folder on their computer, and putting files in that folder syncs them to Dropbox servers and their other devices. Dropbox servers store files durably and securely, and these files are accessible anywhere with an Internet connection.           What\u2019s a sync engine? A sync engine lives on your computer and coordinates uploading and downloading your files to a remote filesystem.         Since then we\u2019ve taken file sync pretty far. We started with consumers syncing what fit on their devices for their own personal use. Now, our users bring Dropbox to their jobs, where they have access to millions of files organized in company sharing hierarchies. The content of these files often far exceeds their computer's local disk space, and they can now use Dropbox Smart Sync to download files only when they need them. Dropbox has hundreds of billions of files, trillions of file revisions, and exabytes of customer data. Users access their files across hundreds of millions of devices, all networked in an enormous distributed system.          Sync at scale is hard         Syncing files becomes much harder at scale, and understanding why is important for understanding why we decided to rewrite. Our first sync engine, which we call \u201dSync Engine Classic,\u201d had fundamental issues with its data model that only showed up at scale, and these issues made incremental improvements impossible.         Distributed systems are hard         The scale of Dropbox alone is a hard systems engineering challenge. But putting raw scale aside, file synchronization is a unique distributed systems problem, because clients are allowed to go offline for long periods of time and reconcile their changes when they return. Network partitions are anomalous conditions for many distributed systems algorithms, yet they are standard operation for us.         Getting this right is important: Users trust Dropbox with their most precious content, and keeping it safe is non-negotiable. Bidirectional sync has many corner cases, and durability is harder than just making sure we don\u2019t delete or corrupt data on the server. For example, Sync Engine Classic represents moves as pairs of deletes at the old location and adds at the new location. Consider the case where, due to a transient network hiccup, a delete goes through but its corresponding add does not. Then, the user would see the file missing on the server and their other devices, even though they only moved it locally.         Durability everywhere is hard         Dropbox also aims to \u201cjust work\u201d on users\u2019 computers, no matter their configuration. We support Windows, macOS, and Linux, and each of these platforms has a variety of filesystems, all with          slightly different behavior         . Under the operating system, there's enormous variation in hardware, and users also install different kernel extensions or drivers that change the behavior          within         the operating system. And above Dropbox, applications all use the filesystem in different ways and rely on behavior that may not actually be part of its specification.         Guaranteeing durability in a particular environment requires understanding its implementation, mitigating its bugs, and sometimes even reverse-engineering it when debugging production issues. These issues often only show up in large populations, since a rare filesystem bug may only affect a very small fraction of users. So at scale, \u201cjust working\u201d across many environments and providing strong durability guarantees are fundamentally opposed.         Testing file sync is hard         With a sufficiently large user base, just about anything that\u2019s theoretically possible will happen in production. Debugging issues in production is much more expensive than finding them in development, especially for software that runs on users\u2019 devices. So, catching regressions with automated testing before they hit production is critical at scale.         However, testing sync engines well is difficult since the number of possible combinations of file states and user actions is astronomical. A shared folder may have thousands of members, each with a sync engine with varied connectivity and a differently out-of-date view of the Dropbox filesystem. Every user may have different local changes that are pending upload, and they may have different partial progress for downloading files from the server. Therefore, there are many possible \u201csnapshots\u201d of the system, all of which we must test.         The number of valid actions to take from a system state is also tremendously large. Syncing files is a heavily concurrent process, where the user may be simultaneously uploading and downloading many files at the same time. Syncing an individual file may involve transferring content chunks in parallel, writing contents to disk, or reading from the local filesystem. Comprehensive testing requires trying different sequences of these actions to ensure our system is free of concurrency bugs.         Specifying sync behavior is hard         Finally, if the large state space wasn\u2019t bad enough, it\u2019s often hard to precisely define correct behavior for a sync engine. For example, consider the case where we have three folders with one nested inside another.         Then, let\u2019s say we have two users\u2014Alberto and Beatrice\u2014who are working within this folder offline. Alberto moves \u201cArchives\u201d into \u201cJanuary,\u201d and Beatrice moves \u201cDrafts\u201d into \u201cArchives.\u201d         What should happen when they both come back online? If we apply these moves directly, we\u2019ll have a cycle in our filesystem graph: \u201cArchives\u201d is the parent of \u201cDrafts,\u201d \u201cDrafts\u201d is the parent of \u201cJanuary,\u201d and \u201cJanuary\u201d is the parent of \u201cArchives.\u201d         What\u2019s the correct final system state in this situation? Sync Engine Classic duplicates each directory, merging Alberto\u2019s and Beatrice\u2019s directory trees. With Nucleus we keep the original directories, and the final order depends on which sync engine uploads their move first.         In this simple situation with three folders and two moves, Nucleus has a satisfying final state. But how do we specify sync behavior in general without drowning in a list of corner cases?          Why rewrite?         Okay, so syncing files at scale is hard. Back in 2016, it looked like we had solved that problem pretty well. We had hundreds of millions of users, new product features like Smart Sync on the way, and a strong team of sync experts. Sync Engine Classic had years of production hardening, and we had spent time hunting down and fixing even the rarest bugs.         Joel Spolsky called rewriting code from scratch the \"          single          worst strategic mistake that any software company can make.         \" Successfully pulling off a rewrite often requires slowing feature development, since progress made on the old system needs to be ported over to the new one. And, of course, there were plenty of user-facing projects our sync engineers could have worked on.         But despite its success, Sync Engine Classic was deeply unhealthy. In the course of building Smart Sync, we'd made many incremental improvements to the system, cleaning up ugly code, refactoring interfaces, and even adding Python type annotations. We'd added copious telemetry and built processes for ensuring maintenance was safe and easy. However, these incremental improvements weren\u2019t enough.         Shipping any change to sync behavior required an arduous rollout, and we'd still find complex inconsistencies in production. The team would have to drop everything, diagnose the issue, fix it, and then spend time getting their apps back into a good state. Even though we had a strong team of experts, onboarding new engineers to the system took years. Finally, we poured time into incremental performance wins but failed to appreciably scale the total number of files the sync engine could manage.         There were a few root causes for these issues, but the most important one was Sync Engine Classic's          data model         . The data model was designed for a simpler world without sharing, and files lacked a stable identifier that would be preserved across moves. There were few consistency guarantees, and we'd spend hours debugging issues where something theoretically possible but \"extremely unlikely\" would show up in production. Changing the foundational nouns of a system is often impossible to do in small pieces, and we quickly ran out of effective incremental improvements.         Next, the system was not designed for testability. We relied on slow rollouts and debugging issues in the field rather than automated pre-release testing. Sync Engine Classic\u2019s permissive data model meant we couldn't check much in stress tests, since there were large sets of undesirable yet still legal outcomes we couldn't assert against. Having a strong data model with tight invariants is immensely valuable for testing, since it's always easy to check if your system is in a valid state.         We discussed above how sync is a very concurrent problem, and testing and debugging concurrent code is          notoriously difficult         . Sync Engine Classic\u2019s threading-based architecture did not help at all, handing all our scheduling decisions to the OS and making integration tests non-reproducible. In practice, we ended up using very coarse-grained locks held for long periods of time. This architecture sacrificed the benefits of parallelism in order to make the system easier to reason about.          A rewrite checklist         Let\u2019s distill the reasons for our decision to rewrite into a \u201crewrite checklist\u201d that can help navigate this kind of decision for other systems.         Have you exhausted incremental improvements?         \u25a1          Have you tried refactoring code into better modules?          Poor code quality alone isn't a great reason to rewrite a system. Renaming variables and untangling intertwined modules can all be done incrementally, and we spent a lot of time doing this with Sync Engine Classic. Python's dynamism can make this difficult, so we added          MyPy          annotations as we went to gradually catch more bugs at compile time. But the core primitives of the system remained the same, as refactoring alone cannot change the fundamental data model.         \u25a1          Have you tried improving performance by optimizing hotspots?          Software often spends most of its time in very little of the code. Many performance issues are not fundamental, and optimizing hotspots identified by a profiler is a great way to incrementally improve performance. We had a team working on performance and scale for months, and they had great results for improving file content transfer performance. But improvements to our memory footprint, like increasing the number of files the system could manage, remained elusive.         \u25a1          Can you deliver incremental value?          Even if you decide to do a rewrite, can you reduce its risk by delivering intermediate value? \u00a0Doing so can validate early technical decisions, help the project keep momentum, and lessen the pain of slowed feature development.         Can you pull off a rewrite?         \u25a1          Do you deeply understand and respect the current system?         It's much easier to write new code than fully understand existing code. So, before embarking on a rewrite, you must deeply understand and respect the \u201cClassic\u201d system. It's the whole reason your team and business is here, and it has years of accumulated wisdom through running in production. Get in there and do archaeology to dig into why everything is the way it is.         \u25a1          Do you have the engineering-hours?          Rewriting a system from scratch is hard work, and getting to full feature completeness will require a lot of time. Do you have these resources? Do you have the domain experts who understand the current system? Is your organization healthy enough to sustain a project of this magnitude?         \u25a1          Can you accept a slower rate of feature development?          We didn't completely pause feature development on Sync Engine Classic, but every change on the old system pushed the finish line for the new one further out. We decided on shipping a few projects, and we had to be very intentional about allocating resources for guiding their rollouts without slowing down the rewriting team. We also heavily invested in telemetry for Sync Engine Classic to keep its steady-state maintenance cost to a minimum.         Do you know what you're going towards?         \u25a1          Why will it be better the second time?          If you've gotten to here, you already understand the old system thoroughly and its lessons to be learned. But a rewrite should also be motivated by changing requirements or business needs. We described earlier how file syncing had changed, but our decision to rewrite was also forward looking. Dropbox understands the growing needs of collaborative users at work, and building new features for these users requires a flexible, robust sync engine.         \u25a1          What are your principles for the new system?          Starting from scratch is a great opportunity to reset technical culture for a team. Given our experience operating Sync Engine Classic, we heavily emphasized testing, correctness, and debuggability from the beginning. \u00a0Encode all of these principles in your data model. \u00a0We wrote out these principles early in the project's lifespan, and they paid for themselves over and over.          So, what did we build?         Here\u2019s a summary of what we achieved with Nucleus. For more details on each one, stay tuned for future blog posts.          We wrote Nucleus in Rust! Rust has been a force multiplier for our team, and betting on Rust was one of the best decisions we made. More than performance, its ergonomics and focus on correctness has helped us tame sync\u2019s complexity. We can encode complex invariants about our system in the type system and have the compiler check them for us.          Almost all of our code runs on a single thread (the \u201cControl thread\u201d) and uses Rust\u2019s           futures library          for scheduling many concurrent actions on this single thread. We offload work to other threads only as needed: network IO to an event loop, computationally expensive work like hashing to a thread pool, and filesystem IO to a dedicated thread. This drastically reduces the scope and complexity developers must consider when adding new features.          The Control thread is designed to be entirely deterministic when its inputs and scheduling decisions are fixed. We use this property to fuzz it with pseudorandom simulation testing. With a seed for our random number generator, we can generate random initial filesystem state, schedules, and system perturbations and let the engine run to completion. Then, if we fail any of our sync correctness checks, we can always reproduce the bug from the original seed. We run millions of scenarios every day in our testing infrastructure.          We redesigned the client-server protocol to have strong consistency. The protocol guarantees the server and client have the same view of the remote filesystem before considering a mutation. Shared folders and files have globally unique identifiers, and clients never observe them in transiently duplicated or missing states. Finally, folders and files support          atomic moves independent of their subtree size. We now have strong consistency checks between the client\u2019s and server\u2019s view of the remote filesystem, and any discrepancy is a bug.

Published:      March 16, 2020      Django      Python      This post now has       a followup     Recently I\u2019ve seen posts and questions pop up in a few places about      a sort of \u201centerprise\u201d Django style guide     that\u2019s been getting attention. There are a number of things I disagree with in that guide, but the big one, and the one people have mostly been asking about, is the recommendation to add a \u201cservice layer\u201d to Django applications. The short version of my opinion on this is: it\u2019s probably not what you want in Django\u00a0apps.     The longer version follows\u00a0below.     What is a service layer,\u00a0anyway?     First it\u2019s helpful to understand what\u2019s meant by \u201cservice\u201d and what the theoretical goal is, so let\u2019s take an example. Suppose you have a Django-powered blog app, with an      Entry     model representing entries in the blog. The standard way to query for entries would be something\u00a0like:     This would get you a      QuerySet     of all\u00a0entries.     The \u201cservice\u201d approach would be to do something\u00a0like:     Where the      service     module implements a variety of functions/methods that, under the hood, call various Django       ORM     methods to actually perform queries and manipulate model objects. Typical \u201cservice\u201d implementations provide at least things like     (or other synonyms for those operations), and often also provide more complex \u201cbusiness logic\u201d methods. In a simple case, things like \u201cpublishing\u201d a blog entry by changing its status from draft to live. More complex data models and logic will end up with more complex service\u00a0layers.     Quick aside: the earliest Django       ORM     was actually a code generator that would leave behind one auto-generated module per model class, very similar to the type of      service     module mentioned here, containing all the query methods for working with that model. For the first public release it was still there, but switched to generating the modules in-memory rather than leaving them on the filesystem. This was confusing and nearly universally frowned upon; if you want an overview of why, skim to the second section of      this old post     , and if you want to know how something like that even gets implemented, I walk through a simplified example      in this other old post     . Anyway, Django 0.95 (released in July 2006) replaced the code generator with the initial implementation of the modern Django       ORM     Meanwhile, the motivations for the service-layer approach mostly come down to two\u00a0things:      Provide a clear place to put \u201cbusiness logic\u201d \u2014 common queries and operations that will need to be performed repeatedly on or with instances of the data\u00a0models.      Hide the underlying implementation from all other code, so that you could swap it out and replace with something else and not have to rewrite any code other than the\u00a0\u201cservice\u201d.     General problems with \u201cservice\u201d\u00a0approaches     I have several general objections to this approach that apply beyond just the use case of\u00a0Django.     One is that this is taking a pretty common principle of \u201centerprise\u201d architecture and applying it without careful consideration. The general idea is to try to put layers of indirection/abstraction in front of various components, so that the actual implementations of those components can be changed without breaking other\u00a0code.     There certainly are times and places when this is a useful thing to do, but there are also times and places when it isn\u2019t useful. A typical web application does involve a lot of components, and it is the case that any application that gets large enough or lasts long enough will eventually want to change/swap some of them. But effort should be focused on the ones that are likely to      actually     get changed/swapped, rather than on some sort of reflex action of always putting layers of indirection in front of everything without pausing to think about whether it\u2019s really useful (see also:       YAGNI     Since I\u2019m going to talk specifically about Django in the next section I\u2019ll use it as an example here: a lot of parts of Django are swappable out of the box in ways that are meant to minimize code changes. Caching layers, session storage, authentication sources, file-storage implementations, logging systems, email-sending, templating languages\u2026 the list of things you can easily swap, because they\u2019ve been put behind configuration and generic/indirect APIs, is pretty long. But it\u2019s also a list that\u2019s informed by experience and actual practice. Or, in other words, it\u2019s a list of things that commonly      do     get changed/swapped over the life of a lot of real projects. Other components, like the forms library, the admin interface, and so on are effectively optional, and often will be dropped for something else, or just not even used in the first\u00a0place.     But what about the data modeling and access component (which in Django\u2019s case is its       ORM     )? In theory, hiding it behind a service layer means you can change it out for something else without rewriting other code. But how often does that really happen in practice? My experience \u2014 and I\u2019ve been working in this industry for over 15 years at places both big and small, and been through some pretty major platform migrations \u2014 is that it happens almost never. Swapping something as major as how you model and persist/retrieve your core data is not something you do lightly, and typically only happens at a time when you\u2019re making other massive changes \u2014 completely switching platform/language/framework, or otherwise doing a ground-up rewrite of the entire system. And, ironically, it\u2019s in the kinds of organizations      most     likely to insist on \u201centerprise\u201d architecture patterns that the payoff is      least     likely ever to be realized, because such organizations are almost fanatically averse to the kind of change this architecture is meant to enable. See, for example, all the places for which we know a decade (or longer) is not even close to enough time to do platform\u00a0upgrades.     A second problem is that when you decide to go the \u201cservice\u201d route, you are changing the nature of your business. This is related to an argument I bring up occasionally when people tell me they don\u2019t use \u201cframeworks\u201d and never will: what they actually mean, whether they realize it or not, is \u201cwe built and now have to maintain and train our developers on our own ad-hoc private framework, on top of whatever our normal business is\u201d. And adopting the service approach essentially means that, whatever your business was previously, now your business is that plus developing and maintaining something close to your own private       ORM     This is a necessary consequence, because sooner or later you\u2019re going to need a significant fraction of the features of whatever your      real     data layer is, which means you will have to implement sufficient features in your service layer to be able to take advantage of them. And I\u2019d bet a lot of money that most places which do this do      not     take the necessary level of care to ensure their reimplementation of those features is truly generic enough to still allow swapping out the underlying implementation. Designing good and thoughtful APIs for interacting with your data is difficult and time-consuming. What\u2019s much easier, and can be done quickly to clear out your cards for the current sprint, is copying someone else\u2019s already-designed     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     , which means the service layer, over time, almost always ends up with an     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     that\u2019s tightly coupled to whatever the underlying data layer\u2019s     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     is, and there goes a lot of the claimed benefit of the service layer out the\u00a0window.     Yet another issue is that this is a solved problem, and the solution is not service layers. If you want a clear separation of \u201cbusiness logic\u201d and \u201cdata access\u201d, and/or believe you need the benefits that you think will come from decoupling them, the solution is      the Data Mapper        ORM      pattern     . Writing a \u201cservice\u201d to hide your real data-access layer is basically just Data Mapper with extra steps and without being able to take advantage of off-the-shelf implementations. And while you will have a theoretically harder time swapping it out for some other underlying component, I\u2019ve already mentioned the problem with trying to optimize for\u00a0that.     Now, about\u00a0Django\u2026     Some of the general objections above apply even more strongly to the specific case of Django. For example: in general, people don\u2019t often swap out their data access layer without also doing other massive rewrites. And in Django-based applications it\u2019s even less likely to try to swap out the       ORM     without other huge code changes happening at the same time, because the Django       ORM     is probably the single most tightly-integrated component of the entire framework \u2014 if you stop using it, you\u2019re throwing away so much other stuff that \u201cwhy are we even still using Django\u201d becomes a really significant\u00a0question.     And I said above that I think the real solution, if you feel like you need the decoupling of \u201cbusiness logic\u201d and data access/modeling, is a Data Mapper       ORM     . Well, Django\u2019s       ORM     is not that; it\u2019s very much an      Active Record       ORM     , and trying to use it in a Data Mapper style is going to result in a lot of unhappiness. You never really want to be fighting against your framework that\u00a0way.     Worse still is the issue of \u201cservice\u201d layers requiring you to basically build your own       ORM     . To really do a backend-agnostic service layer on top of the Django       ORM     , you need to replace or abstract away some of its most fundamental and convenient abstractions. For example, most of the commonly-used       ORM     query methods return either instances of your model classes, or instances of Django\u2019s      QuerySet     class (which is a kind of chained-     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     results wrapper around a query). In order to avoid tightly coupling to the structure and     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     of those Django-specific objects, your service layer needs to translate them into something else \u2014 likely generic iterables to replace      QuerySet     , and some type of \u201cbusiness object\u201d instance to replace model-class instances. Which is a non-trivial amount of work even in patterns like Data Mapper that are designed for this, and even more difficult  to do in an Active Record       ORM     that\u00a0isn\u2019t.     And in the process of abstracting away those underlying       ORM     objects and interfaces, you also are throwing away a lot of their utility.      QuerySet     is already a really cool (no bias on my part here, of course) caching query wrapper with a bunch of functionality to turn common use patterns into efficient query behavior. When you abstract away its existence, you either lose that or have to reimplement it\u00a0yourself.     You\u2019ll also lose, or have to abstract/reimplement, a lot of the integrations between the       ORM     and other parts of Django \u2014 no more handy generic views, no more helpful auto-generating forms or (if you\u2019re using      DRF     ) serializers, and so on, because those all break the \u201cservice\u201d abstraction by exposing other code to the existence and APIs of the underlying       ORM     What to do\u00a0instead     I\u2019ve said a few times in passing, and covered in more detail in the \u201cMastering the Django       ORM     \u201d tutorial I\u2019ve presented a few times at conferences, that (in my opinion) in most well-designed Django applications, the models \u2014 and potentially associated utility code, like custom      Manager     or      QuerySet     subclasses \u2014      are     the     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     exposed to other code. Which in turn means that they are the place where the \u201cbusiness logic\u201d should be\u00a0implemented.     The       ORM     itself already provides the common query patterns you\u2019d implement in a \u201cservice\u201d layer, so you don\u2019t need to reimplement them. When going beyond those, here\u2019s a quick set of recommendations for how to implement\u00a0things:      If you need an alternate constructor for model instances, do it as a manager method (not as a       classmethod      on the model, or in some other class or code elsewhere). In my        ORM      tutorial I use the example of a model that stores an       RGB      color as three integer fields, and implementing a manager method that can build an instance from a hexadecimal value, like      If you have a custom, complex and/or often-used query against the model\u2019s entire table, do it as either a manager method (if you think you\u2019ll never need to use it chained after other query methods), or as a       QuerySet      method (if you will need to be able to chain it after other things). And remember you can write a       QuerySet      subclass with your custom method(s) and then       auto-generate a model manager from it      If you need more complex fetching of related objects from a single model instance, do it as a method on that model\u00a0class.      Any sort of logical operation on only a single model instance should be a method on the model\u00a0class.      Any sort of logical operation on a set of instances of the same model should be a method on the model\u2019s manager or its       QuerySet     If this sounds complex, it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve written out a bunch of specific examples \u2014 the base pattern is \u201cthings that involve one model instance go on the model class; things involving multiple or all instances go on the model\u2019s      QuerySet     or\u00a0manager\u201d.     And in general, other code should obey the      Law of Demeter     with respect to an application\u2019s models. The traditional \u201cone-dot rule\u201d version is a bit inflexible for a language like Python (where lookups often start with      self     ), and for the specific model/manager/query method architecture used in the Django       ORM     , so if you want an exhaustive version of it, code external to a Django model class should restrict itself to\u00a0accessing:      On an instance of the model, any custom public methods, and      . Access to fields (including relationship traversals) for reading should be discouraged, and for writing should be forbidden. Access to      and      should similarly be\u00a0off-limits.      From an instance of a related model, the same as above (essentially allowing a \u201ctwo-dot\u201d access for some\u00a0cases).      On the model class itself, the default constructor, the manager, its top-level object-creation methods (      ) and any alternate constructors or custom top-level query methods, but generally       not      built-in query methods other than      (again, allowing limited \u201ctwo-dot\u201d accesses). The one exception here is for using generic views that need access to a broader range of the query methods (like      ) to do their work; views that are specific to a single model class should be making use of purpose-built query methods on that model\u2019s manager or       QuerySet      instead of embedding their own complex query logic, or retrieving a single instance and then invoking public methods on it that implement the desired logical\u00a0operations.     This usually means views should contain as little \u201cbusiness logic\u201d as possible, instead deferring to the model for that. In the tutorial I give the example of a bug-tracking system where a view that resolves a ticket is implemented by querying for the      Ticket     instance, then manually setting a bunch of its fields and calling     \u2014 then contrast it with an implementation where     is implemented as a method on      Ticket     , so all the view has to do is query up the instance and then call its     method. The second version is almost always going to be the right way to do things (and not just in Django). As the old joke goes, when you want to walk the dog, you shouldn\u2019t reach down and grab and pick up and put down each of its legs manually in order; you should just trust that the dog knows how to     on its own. This is especially true with Active Record ORMs like\u00a0Django\u2019s.     Speaking of which: following the Law of Demeter is a lot harder, and often just plain impossible, in a \u201cservice\u201d approach, because the service layer takes responsibility for implementing \u201cbusiness logic\u201d operations like resolving the      Ticket     or walking the      Dog     , and so has to have detailed knowledge of the structure of those objects and how to reach into them and manipulate their fields (if it didn\u2019t, and those objects instead exposed their own logical     , etc. operations as methods, there\u2019d be no point to the service layer, because the \u201cbusiness logic\u201d would already be implemented\u00a0elsewhere!).     Go forth, and write service layers no\u00a0more     I\u2019ve mentioned a couple times above that I\u2019m presenting my opinions, and usually at the end of a post like this I make a point of reiterating that and saying that if something else works for you, do the thing that works for you. And it\u2019s still true that what I\u2019ve said above is just my opinion, and you shouldn\u2019t necessarily take it as a set of ironclad rules you have to\u00a0follow.     But in this case I\u2019m going to modify my usual statement slightly: the above are not just my random personal preferences. They are opinions, but they\u2019re informed opinions from a      lot     of time spent working on and around large codebases (many in Django, some not), and from seeing what worked and what didn\u2019t. My experience is that attempts to build service layers usually fall into the \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d category, and that sticking mostly to the guidelines I\u2019ve laid out above for how to work with models and \u201cbusiness logic\u201d in Django is more likely to wind up in the \u201cworked\u201d\u00a0category.     And if, after reading this, you still are convinced that a service-layer approach with business logic separate from the data models is the right thing for you, then go for it, but I\u2019ll urge you one last time to at least strongly consider      not     doing it with Django, and instead building on top of a component stack that uses a Data Mapper       ORM     (in the Python world,      SQLAlchemy     is far and away the best choice) that natively incorporates that type of separation. In the long term, I think that\u2019s going to be a much happier and more productive path than trying to fit the square peg of a service layer into the round hole of Django\u2019s Active Record\u00a0approach.

While there were plenty of people who agreed with the general idea of that post, there were also quite a few objections.  And most of those seem to fall into two main categories: people who want some type of additional layer (and may or may not call it a \u201cservice\u201d) as a way of managing cross-cutting complexity, and people who want it as an isolating abstraction for\u00a0testing.     There\u2019s also a third group whose objections are more about the Active Record       ORM     pattern, but that\u2019s not something that can be solved within the context of the Django       ORM     \u2014 it is and likely always will be an Active Record       ORM     . As I mentioned in the previous post, if you want a Data Mapper       ORM     in Python, I think you really should be using      SQLAlchemy     . And you probably      shouldn\u2019t     be using Django at all in that case \u2014 instead, either go with a microframework that lets you plug in whatever you want (most likely      Flask     ), or with a full-stack framework built around SQLAlchemy (your best choice is probably      Pyramid     ). I think you\u2019ll be much happier working with one of those than with trying to retrofit SQLAlchemy, or any other replacement       ORM     So today I\u2019m going to focus mainly on the other two sets of objections. And if you haven\u2019t read      the previous post     , I do recommend you take a look at it now for\u00a0background.     Managing\u00a0complexity     A lot of this group of objections started out with something like \u201cthe examples you mentioned are all basically tiny little toy projects where of course it\u2019s easy to implement the business logic on the models, but I have      real     , really complex applications, so what\u2019s your advice for\u00a0those?\u201d     And the answer is: I gave my advice for how to implement \u201cbusiness logic\u201d in Django, and I stand by it, for projects of any size. Like I said previously, that advice comes from around 15 years of working with Django, on projects large and small. But the real thing people seemed to be getting at, when prodded a bit more, was how to manage cross-cutting complexity when implementing methods on individual models. An example one commenter brought up: if cancelling a recurring billing agreement has to update a half-dozen other things (sending notifications, cancelling any pending orders/shipments, etc. etc.), this argument says, it makes no sense to do it all in a method on a      BillingAgreement     model. So you have to have a service layer where you do\u00a0that!     I agree with the first part of that: it doesn\u2019t make sense to do all those things in a method on a single model. But the conclusion \u2014 you need a service layer for this \u2014 doesn\u2019t follow. First of all, hoisting those half-dozen (or potentially more) things out of a single method on a      BillingAgreement     model and into a single method on, say, a      BillingService     doesn\u2019t actually solve the real problem, which is that a single method is trying to do too much. Taking that over-complex method and just moving it, as-is, into a different place in your code won\u2019t make it stop being over-complex, and won\u2019t make it      OK     for it to be that\u00a0complex.     I was hesitant to get into this in the previous post because there\u2019s no easy answer. There are a lot of patterns for designing software to handle this type of complexity without having to put huge chunks of it into just a few overburdened methods or classes, but none of them are one-size-fits-all. To take one example: in the reddit thread for the previous post I mentioned that several larger codebases (both Django and non-) I\u2019ve worked with have eventually integrated, or at least bolted on, some type of publish/subscribe message broker. This can be a useful solution, because often what\u2019s really wanted when breaking up these complex cross-cutting methods is a way to have many different components work together but not necessarily have to possess knowledge of, or directly invoke, each other. Having each component publish messages about what it\u2019s doing, and requiring others to subscribe and react to the specific types of messages they care about, can accomplish\u00a0this.     But that\u2019s far from the only possible solution, and depending on what you\u2019re doing it may be entirely wrong, or otherwise have disadvantages that outweigh the advantages. The real answer here is not to memorize one solution and apply it everywhere; it\u2019s to build up broader familiarity with patterns and principles for designing complex software systems, and take care in choosing which ones you use in a given situation. Which is certainly easier said than done \u2014 there are a lot of documented patterns out there and a huge amount of literature advocating for or against particular ones \u2014 but again there just isn\u2019t an easy universal solution. If there were, we\u2019d all be able to adopt it and get on with our\u00a0lives.     And once you start adopting design patterns that let you break up and manage the type of cross-concern complexity so many people brought up, you no longer have, or no longer have so many, complex chunks of code that need to do lots of different things. Which then gets back into implementing \u201cbusiness logic\u201d operations directly on your models (or their auxiliary classes like managers and querysets, as appropriate). This is a big reason why I put a long aside about the Law of Demeter (also known as the principle of least knowledge \u2014 minimizing how many other things and how many details about them any given piece of code needs to know) in the original post. A lot of the motivation behind service layers, or other dedicated places to put \u201cbusiness logic\u201d separate from other concerns, in my experience, comes from the difficulty of adhering to these sorts of deep design principles. I\u2019ve been as guilty of this as anyone over the course of my career; it\u2019s awfully convenient sometimes to bend or even break these principles to get something done and out the door quickly. But the bill for that also always comes due sooner or\u00a0later.     Isolation and\u00a0testing     This was the less common objection, but several instances of it came in messages from people I know and respect, and who made more generally thoughtful arguments than some of the other discussions I saw. In its simplest form, this argument may seem like what I already talked about in the previous post: using a layer of indirection to make it easier to swap out the       ORM     . But the key difference is that where other people will want this to make it easier to permanently remove/replace the data access layer, this group wants to be able to      temporarily     replace the       ORM     during test runs, but have it present and available at all other\u00a0times.     This is often part of a more general approach of trying to reduce the number of dependencies involved in running tests (and in this case, both the       ORM     and the database(s) it will talk to are dependencies). One benefit of this is faster test runs; another benefit is needing less infrastructure to get the tests to run. And there are also philosophical arguments about unit tests versus integration tests which drive people toward wanting the ability to test individual pieces of application logic in a way that doesn\u2019t turn into an implicit test of the full component\u00a0stack.     I\u2019ll admit I find it more difficult to argue against this than the other reasons people advance for wanting a service layer abstraction in Django, because there\u2019s an extent to which I agree with the underlying idea: I like being able to test specific pieces of logic in isolation from the overall system they\u2019ll be a part of, and I routinely use a variety of techniques to make this easier to\u00a0do.     But I\u2019m not able to go all the way on this argument, for a couple of\u00a0reasons.     One is that I don\u2019t really believe in full isolation of \u201clogic\u201d. It may well be I\u2019m just not good enough to pull it off, but I\u2019ve had some downright embarrassing experiences when attempting it. There are a lot of things that can go wrong when using mocks, fake-factories and other tools to simulate a dependency, and it\u2019s easy to wind up with misplaced confidence because the beautifully-isolated tests were operating with incorrect or incomplete simulations of key dependencies, or even just testing against the wrong things. So generally, the more complex or crucial to the application a dependency is, the less likely I am to try to isolate/mock it away and the more likely I am to use the real thing. A hybrid approach of trying to have some \u201cpure\u201d tests that use simulated dependencies and other less-pure tests that use the real thing is possible, of course, but raises questions about why so much effort is put into isolating the \u201clogic\u201d from the \u201cdependencies\u201d if test runs are going to have to use the real dependencies at some point\u00a0anyway.     And in the specific domain of web applications, I tend to see the database as a sufficiently complex/crucial dependency that I don\u2019t think trying to isolate it away in tests is a good\u00a0approach.     The other reason is that I see re-architecting for testability as a diminishing-returns project. That is, at first the changes you\u2019ll make for testability are mostly easy wins and usually produce a net gain in overall code quality, or at worst are neutral in its impact on other metrics. But past a certain point the gains in testability begin to be outweighed by the amount of code churn to accomplish them and by losses in other forms of quality. When it comes to introducing entire new layers of abstraction/indirection in front of major components, I think that diminishing-returns point has often been\u00a0passed.     And even without the       ORM     -specific objections from the last post, it\u2019s important to remember those layers don\u2019t come for free: they become a permanent part of the codebase that you and every other developer on your team will have to work with and account for. Especially as a project grows larger, it\u2019s vital to treat complexity as a budgeted resource, and use care in deciding where and how to spend that budget. While I suspect others have different opinions, I\u2019m not convinced that introducing service layers in Django apps will produce enough overall gain to justify the chunk of the complexity budget that has to be spent on\u00a0it.     A wrap (for\u00a0now)     At this point I think I\u2019m pretty much argued out on this topic; if you\u2019re in the camp of wanting service layers in Django apps and I haven\u2019t changed your mind with the roughly 5,000 words of these two posts I doubt I\u2019d be able to do it with 10,000 more. If you were curious or on the fence about whether service layers in Django apps are a good idea, or just wanting to know what an argument against them would look like, hopefully I\u2019ve been able to lay out my take on it clearly\u00a0enough.     Next time: I\u2019m not sure yet what topic, but probably something      other     than service layers in Django\u00a0apps.

In this section, we show how to runexperiments probing average treatment effect estimation on the            World3simulator           .World3 is a dynamical systems model that studies the interplay between naturalresource constraints, population growth, and industrial development.           First, we examine all of the experiments available for World3.           These experiments generate datasets both in the setting of a pure randomizedcontrol trial (            PollutionRCT           ), as well as with (unobserved) confounding andmediation. We will run a randomized control experiment. The description propertyoffers specific details about the experiment.rct.description           We can run the experiment using the experiment            run           function and specifying adesired sample size            num_samples           . The experiment then returns a causal            Dataset           consisting of the covariates for each unit, the treatment assignment,the outcome, and the ground truth causal effect for each unit. All of this datais contained in NumPy arrays, which makes it easy to connect to causalestimators.           WhyNot also enables you to run a large collection of causal estimators on thedata for benchmarking and comparison. The main function to do this is the            causal_suite           which, given the causal dataset, runs all of the estimators onthe dataset and returns an            InferenceResult           for each estimator containing itsestimated treatment effects and uncertainty estimates like confidence intervals.    dataset.covariates, dataset.treatments, dataset.outcomes)           In addition to experiments studying average treatment effect, WhyNot also supportscausal inference experiments studying            Heterogeneous treatment effects,            Time-varying treatment policies            Causal structure discovery           Sequential decision making           WhyNot supports experimentation with sequential decision making andreinforcement learning via unified interface with the            OpenAIgym           . In this section, we give a simple exampleshowing how to use the            HIV simulator           for sequential decision making experiments.           First, we initialize the environment and set the random seed.           Observations in the simulator are a set of 6 states, capturing infected anduninfected T-lymphocytes, macrophages, immune response, and copies of freevirus. Actions correspond to choosing between different drugs and dosages for           For illustration, we repeatedly chose actions, which correspond to treatmentpolicy decisions, in the environment and measure both the next state and thereward. In this case, the reward weighs the strength of the immune response, thevirus count, and the cost of the chosen treatment.           For more details on the simulation, as well as a fully worked out policygradient example, see            this notebook           .           Strategic classification           Beyond settings typically studied in sequential decision making, WhyNot alsosupports experiments with standard supervised learning algorithms in dynamicsettings. In this section, we show how to use WhyNot to study the performance ofclassifiers when individuals being classified            behave strategically           toimprove their outcomes, a problem sometimes called            strategicclassification           .           First, we set up the            creditenvironment           .           Observations in this environment correspond to a dataset of features for eachindividual and a label indicating whether they experience financial distressfrom the Kaggle            GiveMeSomeCredit dataset           .           Actions in the environment correspond to choosing a classifier to predictdefault. In response, individuals then            strategically adapt           their features inorder to obtain a more favorable credit score. The subsequent observation is theadapted features, and the reward is the classifier's loss on this distribution           We can then experiment with the long-term equilibrium arising from repeatedlyupdating the classifier to cope with strategic response.           For more details on the simulation and a complete example showing thestandard retraining procedures perform in a strategic setting, see            thisnotebook           .           Beyond strategic classification, WhyNot also supports simulators and experimentsevaluating other aspects of machine learning, e.g.            fairnesscriteria           ,in dynamic settings.           For more examples and demonstrations of how to design and conductexperiments in each of these settings, check out            usage           andour collection of            examples           .           Simulators in WhyNot           WhyNot provides a large number of simulated environments from fields rangingfrom economics to epidemiology. Each simulator comes equipped with arepresentative set of causal inference experiments and exports a uniform Pythoninterface that makes it easy to construct new causal inference experiments inthese environments, as well as an            OpenAI gym           interface to perform reinforcement learning experiments in new environments.           The simulators in WhyNot currently include:             HIV Treatment Simulator             Dynamic Integrated Climate Economy Model (DICE)             Zika Epidemic Simulator             Opioid Epidemic Simulator             World3             World2             Lotka-Volterra Model             Incarceration Simulator             Civil Violence Simulator             Schelling Model             LaLonde Synthetic Outcome Model             Delayed Impact             Performative Prediction Credit Simulator           For a detailed overview of these simulators, please see the            simulatordocumentation           .

Frequently asked questions            1. Why is it called WhyNot?           Why not?            2. What are the intended use cases?           WhyNot supports multiple use cases, some technical, some pedagogical, eachsuited for a different group of users. We envision at least five primary use             <strong>              Developing             : Researchers can use WhyNot in the process of developing newmethods for causal inference and decision making in dynamic settings.  WhyNotcan serve as a substitute for ad-hoc synthetic data where needed, providing agreater set of challenging test cases.             <strong>              Testing             : Researchers can use WhyNot to design robustness checks formethods and gain insight into the failure cases of these methods.             <strong>              Benchmarking             : Practitioners can use WhyNot to compare multiple methods onthe same set of tasks. WhyNot does not dictate any particular benchmark, butrather supports the community in creating useful benchmarks.             <strong>              Learning             : Students of causality and dynamic decision making might findWhyNot to be a helpful training resource. WhyNot is easy-to-use and does notrequire much prior experience to get started with.             <strong>              Teaching             : Instructors can use WhyNot as a tool students engage with tolearn and solve problems.            3. What uses are             not            intended?             <strong>              Basis of real-world policy and interventions             : The simulators included inWhyNot were selected because they offer realistic technical challenges forcausal inference and dynamic decision making tools, not because they offerfaithful models of the real world. In many cases, they have been contested orcriticized as representations of the real world. For this reason, thesimulators should not directly be used to design real-world interventions or             <strong>              Substitute for healthy debate             : Success in simulated environments does notguarantee success in real scenarios, but a failure in simulated environmentscan nonetheless lead to insight into weaknesses of a particular approach.WhyNot does not obviate the need for debate around common assumptions incausal inference.             <strong>              Substitute for real world experiments and data             : WhyNot does not substitutefor high-quality empirical work on real data sets. WhyNot is a tool forunderstanding and evaluating methods for causal inference and decision makingin dynamics, not certifying their validity in real-world scenarios.             <strong>              Substitute for theory             : WhyNot can help create understanding in contextswhere theoretical analysis is challenging, but does not reduce the need fortheoretical guarantees and formal analysis.            4. Why start from dynamical systems?           Dynamical systems provide a natural setting to study causal inference. Thephysical world is a dynamical system, and causal inference inevitably has tograpple with data generated from some dynamical process. Moreover, the temporalstructure of the dynamics gives rise to nontrivial problem instances with bothconfounding and mediation. Dynamics also naturally lead to time-varying causaleffects and allow for time-varying treatments and sequential decision making.            5. What what simulators are included and why?           WhyNot contains a range of different simulators, and an overview is provided inthe documentation            here           .            6. What\u2019s the difference between WhyNot and CauseMe?            CauseMe           is an online platform for benchmarking causaldiscovery methods. Users can register and evaluate causal discovery methods onan existing repository of data sets, or contribute their own data sets withknown ground truth. CauseMe is an excellent platform that we recommend inaddition to WhyNot. We encourage users to export data sets derived from WhyNotand make them accessible through CauseMe. In this case, we ask that youreference WhyNot.            7. What\u2019s the difference between WhyNot and CausalML?           CausalML is a Python package that provides a range of causal inference methods.The estimators provided by CausalML are available in WhyNot via the            whynot_estimators           package.  While WhyNot provides simulators and derivedexperimental designs on synthetic data, CausalML focuses on providingestimators. We made these estimators available for use on top of WhyNot.            8. What\u2019s the difference between WhyNot and EconML?           EconML is a Python package that provides tools from machine learning andeconometrics for causal inference. Like CausalML, EconML focuses on providingestimators, and we made these estimators available for use on top of WhyNot.            9. How can I best contribute to WhyNot?

(              #127              )              Jan 17, 2019          README.rst           MonkeyType           MonkeyType collects runtime types of function arguments and return values, andcan automatically generate stub files or even add draft type annotationsdirectly to your Python code based on the types collected at runtime.           Example           Say            some/module.py           originally contains:    return a + b           And            myscript.py           contains:          <pre>from some.module import add           Now we want to infer the type annotation of            add           in            some/module.py           byrunning            myscript.py           with            MonkeyType           . One way is to run:          <pre>$ monkeytype run myscript.py           By default, this will dump call traces into a SQLite database in the file            monkeytype.sqlite3           in the current working directory. You can then use the            monkeytype           command to generate a stub file for a module, or apply the typeannotations directly to your code.           Running            monkeytype stub some.module           will output a stub:           Running            monkeytype apply some.module           will modify            some/module.py           to:    return a + b           This example demonstrates both the value and the limitations ofMonkeyType. With MonkeyType, it's very easy to add annotations thatreflect the concrete types you use at runtime, but those annotations may notalways match the full intended capability of the functions. For instance,            add           is capable of handling many more types than just integers. Similarly, MonkeyTypemay generate a concrete            List           annotation where an abstract            Sequence           or            Iterable           would be more appropriate. MonkeyType's annotations are aninformative first draft, to be checked and corrected by a developer.           Motivation           Readability and static analysis are the primary motivations for adding typeannotations to code. It's already common in many Python style guides todocument the argument and return types for a function in its docstring;annotations are a standardized way to provide this documentation, which alsopermits static analysis by a typechecker such as            mypy           .           For more on the motivation and design of Python type annotations, see            PEP 483           and            PEP 484           .           Requirements           MonkeyType requires Python 3.6+ and the            retype           library (for applying typestubs to code files). It generates only Python 3 type annotations (no type           Installing           Install MonkeyType with            pip           :          <pre>pip install MonkeyType           How MonkeyType works           MonkeyType uses the            sys.setprofile           hook provided by Python to interpose onfunction calls, function returns, and generator yields, and record the types ofarguments / return values / yield values.           It generates            stub files           based on that data, and can use            retype           to apply thosestub files directly to your code.

For a 64 bit build (from Cygwin64), configure Z3's sources with           A 32 bit build should work similarly (but is untested); the same is true for 32/64 bit builds from within Cygwin32.           By default, it will install z3 executable at            PREFIX/bin           , libraries at            PREFIX/lib           , and include files at            PREFIX/include           , where            PREFIX           installation prefix if inferred by the            mk_make.py           script. It is usually            /usr           for most Linux distros, and            /usr/local           for FreeBSD and macOS. Usethe           command line option to change the install prefix. For example:make           To uninstall Z3, use           To clean Z3 you can delete the build directory and run the            mk_make.py           script again.           Building Z3 using CMake           Z3 has a build system using CMake. Read the            README-CMake.md           file for details. It is recommended for most build tasks,except for building OCaml bindings.           Z3 bindings           Z3 has bindings for various programming languages.            .NET           You can install a nuget package for the latest release Z3 from            nuget.org           .           Use the           command line flag with            mk_make.py           to enable building these.           On non-windows platforms            mono           is required. On theseplatforms the location of the C# compiler and gac utility need to be known. Youcan set these as follows if they aren't detected automatically. For example:           Note for very old versions of Mono (e.g.            2.10           ) you may need to set            CSC           to           .           Note that when            make install           is executed on non-windows platforms the GACutility is used to install            Microsoft.Z3.dll           into the            GAC           as the            Microsoft.Z3.Sharp           package. During install a            pkg-config           file            Microsoft.Z3.Sharp.pc           ) is also installed which allows the            MonoDevelop           IDE to find the bindings. Running            make uninstall           will remove the dll from the GAC and the            pkg-config           file.           See             examples/dotnet           for examples.            C           These are always enabled.           See             examples/c           for examples.           These are always enabled.           See           for examples.            Java           Use the           command line flag with            mk_make.py           to enable building these.           See             examples/java           for examples.            OCaml           Use the           command line flag with            mk_make.py           to enable building these.           See             examples/ml           for examples.            Python           You can install the Python wrapper for Z3 for the latest release from pypi using the command           Use the           command line flag with            mk_make.py           to enable building these.           Note that is required on certain platforms that the Python package directory            site-packages           on most distributions and            dist-packages           on Debian baseddistributions) live under the install prefix. If you use a non standard prefixyou can use the            --pypkgdir           option to change the Python package directoryused for installation. For example:           If you do need to install to a non standard prefix a better approach is to usea            Python virtual environment           and install Z3 there. Python packages also work for Python3.Under Windows, recall to build inside the Visual C++ native command build environment.Note that the            build/python/z3           directory should be accessible from where python is used with Z3and it depends on            libz3.dll           to be in the path.           <pre>virtualenv venvmakemake install           See             examples/python           for examples.

What that means is you get 1 million requests per month, or 3.2 million seconds of compute time per month, for free. Forever.      You can deploy a simple Flask app on Lambda, which will make your web requests for you from within AWS\u2019 network, rather than your local, or web scraping machine\u2019s IP address. This can help you get around firewalls*, or websites that will block your IP address after repeated requests. The deployment is seamlessly handled by       Zappa      , a framework for managing serverless Python applications.      *At the time of this writing, you can deploy your proxy servers in 16 different countries on AWS (       source      How does it work?      We start with a simple       Flask      application,       proxy.py      , which takes in a POST request containing a URL. The app will make a GET request to that URL, and return the pickled response object.      Instead of your process making requests directly to a URL, it now does so through the proxy server URL.      You can now interact with the requests response object as you would normally:      Here\u2019s a demo of running the proxy server locally, with       python proxy.py      Now of course, we don\u2019t want to run this thing locally. That defeats the whole purpose of a proxy. To get this app running on the cloud, we leverage the Python serverless framework,       Zappa      . Zappa takes a config file,       zappa_settings.json      , and automatically creates Lambda functions which serve your Flask application.      Here, I tell Zappa to create two Lambda functions, one in the      region and another in the      region.      The deployment is a simple Zappa cli call,       zappa deploy --all      . As you can see, it takes just over a minute to deploy two Lambda functions and all the associated AWS configurations (API gateway, IAM roles, etc..)      Now, we can grab the URL for the proxy we want to use and make a post request against it:      If you\u2019re interested in trying this out, head over to this       repo      for full setup instructions.

Requirements            iTerm2 Version 3.3 or later            Python 3.5 or later           Installation           Make sure that you are running Python 3.5 or later            Enable Python API usage           in iTerm preferences.           Example          <blockquote>            The layout, number of panes, tabs, titles and commands is configurable and is detailed below.           Usage           Open iTerm and simply run the below command           If you don't provide            -c           flag, itomate will look for            itomate.yml           file in the current directory and use that.           Here is the list of options available           Configuration           Configuration file to set up the sessions has the format below           Details for each of the configuration objects above is given below              Key              Description               version              Refers to the itomate configuration version. Should always be 1.               tabs              Windows or tabs in the iTerm window.               window-1              Replace with the unique project id e.g.               web-catalog-pim               title              Title to be shown in the title bar of the current tab               position              Position of the pane in the window. It has the format of               number1/number2              where               number1              refers to the column and               number2              refers to the row in the column. More on this later in the readme.               position              is the only required key in a pane               commands              List of commands to execute in the current pane.           Layouts           The parameter            position           in each pane decides where each of the window panes will be displayed. The position value has the format below           <pre>x / y \u2013 both x and y are required parametersy: refers to the row of the given column x</pre>           Here are some of the examples for different pane layouts           Single Pane Window           For single pane, since there is one column and one row, the position for pane would be            1/1           Here is how the configuration would look like           Two Panes Vertical Split Layout           For two panes with equal split or in other words two columns with one row in each, the positions would be            1/1           for the pane on the left and            2/1           for the pane on the right i.e. the second column.|                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  |           Here is how it would look in the configuration           Two Columns, Three Panes Layout           The layout below now has two columns. First column has only one row so position for that would be            1/1           . For the second column we have two panes i.e. two rows; first pane in the second column would be            2/1           and the second one would be            2/2           .|                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  ||                  |                  |           Configuration for that would be:           Note that the            commands           and            title           are optional parameters in panes. Only            position           is required.

Similar Projects           There is            itermocil           which relies on            Applescript that has been deprecated by iTerm           , has limited layout options, and is pretty limited in terms of what it can achieve because of AppleScript. iTomate on the other hand uses iTerm's            newly introduced Python API           , has flexible layouts support and can be extended using iTerm's pretty powerful API.

The source data for these can be found here:           Tools           There are currently 2 tools checked in.           1 - The COVID-19 Distance Widget that is from the PSG-Widgets repository           2 - The COVID-19 Confirmed Cases Graphs           Requirements           Running The .py Files           If you want to run the Python code, you need to install PySimpleGUI.  You'll also need geopy if you want to run the Widget.           These are easily installable via pip.           EXE Files           If you don't want to bother with setting up a Python environment and just want to run the programs by themselves, then you'll find EXE files in this GitHhub.  The EXE files were created using the PySimpleGUI-exemaker program (available via pip).  It uses pyinstaller as described in the PySimpleGUI documentation.           COVID-19 Grid of Graphs Interactive Data Display           Introduction           Viewing multiple series of data as a grid of graphs enables the viewer to quickly and easily get both the big picture as well as information on indivdual countries.  It's much like the way Tableau displays data.           Rather than using Matplotlib or any other graphing packages, this program uses PySimpleGUI's built-in drawing primitives. The code to create a graph is literally a couple of lines of code.  One is a for-each statement that forms the loop, the other line of code draws the bars.           This program uses the Johns Hopkins Time-Series data that is posted here:           Two files are used, one for confirmed cases, the other for deaths.           Each graph displays a header that shows the country name, the number of new cases/deaths in the last data point and the % increase this value represents.           First Run           The first time you run the program it will create a default config file.  You will be shown the \"settings\" and the \"choose locations\" windows.  Any time you change the settings / locations, your choices will be saved in the file named C19-Graph.cfg.  This file is a JSON file.  If it gets corrupted (it shouldn't), delete it and run the program again to create a new one.           Locations           The country list is generated from the data file.  Choose the locations you want to graph using this GUI window.  Make sure the number of graphs you configure in your settings is large enough to hold your chosen countries.  The default setting is 8 graphs - 4 columns in 2 rows.           Settings           In addition to being able to chose the locations to display, you can also set:            The data to display - confirmed cases or deaths            The PySimpleGUI Color Theme            Number of graphs (rows and columns)            The size of each graph in pixels            Scaling - autoscaled or scale to a particular value            Number of days to display           Displaying Current Values           The default view displays only the current values and has autoscaling initially enabled.  Autoscaling will set each graph's max Y value to the max value found in the data for the country.  All graphs will be the same height when autoscaled.  Autoscaled graphs enable you to easily compare the 'shape' of the curves.           When autoscaling is turned off the absolute values for each country are displayed. This enables you to see which countries have more cases than the other countries.  It's immediately evident that Italy has the most cases in this graph.           Scrolling Through Historical Data           Use the slider labeled \"Way back machine\" to adjust the range of dates that are displayed.  The very top of the window displays the range being shown.  By stepping the slider one day at a time you can watch the changes over time.           In this graph the data has been rewound 7 days and shows at the top that 2/14/20 to 3/15/20 are displayed:           Predicting The Future             Caution Advised           - The prediction feature is based on a simple exponential growth formula.  You have control over the growth rate which has a default value of 1.25.  This means that each day's change will be 1.25 times the prior day's change.  It's meant to help inform you of             one possible outcome           among many.           One thing that is become clear, it's the citizens in each country that has direct control over how quickly and how much the virus spreads.  You as an individual have the potential to help or hurt your local population.  Each person that gets the virus spreads it to 2 to 3 people.  By staying home, away from other people, you reduce both the chance you catch the virus and the number of other people you potentially expose if you are infected.           Predicted values are shown in red.           Use the \"Enable Forecasting\" checkbox on the main window to enable forecasting.  Then use the slider to change the number of days into the future to predict. As mentioned previously, you can change the default growth rate of 1.25 to any value.  When you enable forecasting, the number of rows in your window will double.  If you disable forecasting, the number of rows will halve.  Be sure you have enough graphs configured in your settings to display all of the countries you selected.           This graph is showing the predicted number of deaths 7 days into the future.           As Many As You Want           Want to see 81 countries in 1 shot?   No problem.  The limit on the number of graphs is limited only by how much data is available.  If you have a large enough display then you can easily create a 200 or more graph display.           The big picture is that we're all in the exact same virus infested boat.           The lessons learned will be from each other.           The Distance Tracker           This was the first of these tools developed and was publised in the PSG Widgets Repo first.           NOTES           This may be the first major health crisys captured in this much detail and made available widely to the research community / public.  It'll be the best documented and will make post-mortems much easier to perform down the road when we piece together \"what really happened\".           STAY SAFE           Listen to reputable news stations for information           Stay away from information sources that are not scientifically verified to be true           The WHO is the most trustworthy information at this time (most likely)            Download their daily PDF files           that have the \"Situation Report\" for the most up to date information.           Contributing           Have a suggestion?  Open an Issue with your ideas.           At the moment, the focus is on expanding this software using a design I've already created rather than rolling in suggested changes by other people.  Feel free to folk the repo and go crazy.  Please understand that submitting a change doesn't mean it'll be automatically accepted.  If it's not and you think you'll be upset, then perhaps skip submitting it.

SUBSCRIBE               March 18, 2020, 3:29 PM UTC              By              Olivia Solon and April Glaser              Emerson Boggs, 25, a Ph.D. student and virologist at the University of Pittsburgh, signed up on Jan. 23 to moderate what was then a small Reddit community with about 1,000 members dedicated to a relatively obscure topic: a new coronavirus that had been discovered in Wuhan, China.              Less than two months later, the Reddit message board /r/coronavirus has grown to more than 1.2 million members \u2014 almost a million of whom signed up in the last two weeks. Boggs is now one of a team of 60               volunteer content moderators              , including researchers of infectious diseases, virologists, computer scientists, doctors and nurses, spending hours policing the more than 50,000 daily comments posted by the community for misinformation, trolls and off-topic political discussions.              Their expertise and unpaid labor have helped create one of the most authoritative, up-to-date and civil forums for information and discussion about the pandemic.              \"No matter how much it makes my blood pressure rise, it helps me sleep at night knowing I at least tried to help,\" said Boggs, who noted that the University of Pittsburgh is not affiliated with the subreddit.              The coronavirus community is now the third-most active subreddit, according to               Redditlist              , a website that tracks Reddit, and one of the fastest growing subreddits ever.              Every day, Boggs and the other moderators work through a queue of thousands of comments and posts that have been flagged for review. They coordinate via the messaging platform Discord to ensure they aren't duplicating work or to settle any disagreements. Some spend time developing tools to automate or improve their workflow, inviting high-profile scientists and doctors to participate in \"Ask Me Anything\" Q&amp;A sessions and recruiting more moderators. NBC News' medical correspondent, Dr. John Torres recently               participated in one              .              The moderators play to their strengths. In Boggs' case, that's making sure posts submitted by users are scientifically accurate. This involves checking the sources of information and deleting posts if they rely on flimsy or poorly interpreted evidence and adding labels to posts linking to scientific papers that aren't peer reviewed.                   <div class=\"absolute absolute-fill w100 df items-center items-center-m justify-center justify-center-m\">                 Plan to send $1000 checks to Americans has wide support, analyst says                <span>                 March 18, 2020                <span>                 02:57              Until Monday, when she was sent home, Boggs squeezed this work, which she considers a civic duty, into breaks from analyzing the HIV virus with a laser scanning microscope in the Infectious Diseases and Microbiology Department at her university's Graduate School of Public Health.

This is probably having a big impact on my overall stress level and ability to pay attention to other work,\" said Barber, who has a lung condition that makes him more susceptible to COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus. \"But at the same time, I feel like it's worth it. I don't know that we are saving the world, but I do know people are coming here and finding things they can send in a group message to someone who isn't convinced they need to stay at home. Or finding some good news to show a friend who is in a state of despair about it.\"              Barber, who previously worked in Silicon Valley as a data scientist for a health care analytics company and co-founded a venture capital firm, is now a Ph.D. student at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign researching conflicts between people and the online platforms they use.              \"It's like a startup without having to leave the house,\" Barber said. \"We're recruiting people, interacting with a lot of users. We are all spending a lot of time doing this. But we don't have to raise money. And I have way more intrinsic motivation to do this than any of the startups I was involved in.\"              As the community has grown, the moderators have battled to curb the spread of misinformation and panic about the pandemic. They've done it by adhering to a list of principles, the highest priority of which is to be a reliable information source, Barber said.              One way they have done that is by banning political posts, said Patrick Doherty, 29, a moderator who has a master's degree in biology from the University of Notre Dame and studied infectious diseases, including tuberculosis.              \"When you don't allow political posts, it's harder for misinformation to spread,\" said Doherty, who moderates the forum at night and during his lunch break. \"I'd rather have policy discussion and talk about new cases and containment measures.\"              That hasn't stopped people from trying to turn the community into a \"Twitter fight,\" Barber said, referring to \"folks who are habituated to using the internet to be hyper-tribal on the left and right.\"              \"Both sides are equally capable of being indignant,\" he said.              Moderators also banned text-only posts in which people ask questions or make observations rather than share links to credible sources, even if posted with good intentions.              \"People are scared, and if they think they have knowledge of something, it gives them a sense of control with something they don't have control over,\" Boggs said.              To mitigate racist and xenophobic posts that have emerged as the disease has spread among countries, the moderators have deployed automated tools to notify them when certain slurs or dog whistles are used. \"There's a lot of anti-Chinese racism,\" Boggs said. That includes references to \"bat soup,\" which stems from the false reports that the virus originated from a               Chinese influencer eating bat soup in a widely circulated video              .              \"I was expecting a very large influx of active disinformation and toxicity,\" said Kat Lo, an online moderation researcher at the nonprofit Meedan, which builds tools to improve online information. \"But it looks like the moderators have made people not feel empowered to be extremely racist or spread disinformation.\"              Cristina L\u00f3pez, a senior researcher at the nonprofit research institute Data and Society who specializes in disinformation online, said: \"On other platforms, like Facebook or Twitter, the attention economy is usually ruled by whatever is new or catchy, which is why information that appears polarizing or information that is attention-grabbing usually gets more engagement.\"              In contrast, the culture of the coronavirus subreddit provides incentives for users to share quality information, because they are rewarded with upvotes only if they follow the rules.              \"So that in itself is a huge, huge help to getting the best information up top,\" she said.            <div class=\"articleBylineContainer mt8\">                Olivia Solon               Olivia Solon is a tech investigations editor for NBC News in San Francisco.

As events like the Saint Patrick\u2019s Day parade and Boston Marathon were canceled or postponed and bars and gathering places were shuttered,             Governor Charlie Baker responded            to the rumor: \u201cEverybody needs to get their news from legitimate places, not from their friend\u2019s friend\u2019s friend\u2019s friend.\u201d            Where did this rumor come from? A blog by a known conspiracy theorist was making the rounds on social media, perhaps triggering residents\u2019 memories of the Boston Marathon bombing as painful reminders of what is possible in a crisis.

In the middle of a massive and growing coronavirus shutdown, social media is more important than ever. With soft quarantines in place, Facebook, Twitter, and other services are taking on an entirely new valence as the foundation for our everyday lives\u2014a crucial conduit between families, friends, and coworkers, as well as much-needed entertainment. As we become more isolated physically, social media and the web will also have to shoulder the world\u2019s information needs as more and more people seek timely and local information.            And yet the World Health Organization worries that in fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, they must also combat an             infodemic            , which it defines as \u201can overabundance of information\u2014some accurate and some not\u2014that makes it hard for people to find trustworthy sources and reliable guidance when they need it.\u201d In a press conference over the weekend, Governor Baker reminded listeners that TV and newspapers are the most reliable ways to obtain information, and he warned against relying on social media.            Without thoughtful strategies to prevent the spread of bad information,             a lot            could go wrong. Social-media platforms             continue            to be a dangerous socio-technical vulnerability in times of confusion and crisis. When information is scarce, opportunities abound for media manipulators to trade on chaos and fear.            New rules for old tools            We confront a paradox. The same technological infrastructure that perpetuates the infodemic is created by platform companies that profit off the unrelenting spread of information. These are also the same communication tools we must use to fight against it. As platforms adapt, all design decisions are also political ones.

This has led to some unusual decisions, such as             Louisiana postponing its Democratic primary election            , even while other states are cautiously proceeding. Confusion about primaries,             especially after the Iowacaucus debacle            , has already led to fervent rumor-mongering and conspiracy-spreading on Twitter. Bungling the way the public is informed of an intentional postponement could be even worse. As well,             Facebook took down            advertisements after Democrats and activists called out Trump's reelection campaign for an ad that confusingly read, \u201cPresident Trump needs you to take the Official 2020 Congressional District Census today.\u201d            Meanwhile, black Americans continue to be targeted by misinformation campaigns with potentially deadly consequences. Just this week,             CNN investigated Russian connections            to an influence operation, where Africans posed as black Americans on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram in an attempt to gain followers and capture attention on racial wedge issues. The             second campaign involved health misinformation            , where untrue rumors about             black people being immune to            Covid-19 were circulating at the same time that             black celebrities posted a coronavirus conspiracy video            .            Assessing the impact of misinformation is complicated, and once it is politicized it can             can also be overstated            or             understated            . Yet, as social-media companies have learned,             doing nothing about abuse on their platforms can kill            . Social distancing, though, will surely make our ability to combat an infodemic more difficult, especially as our touch points with our neighbors dwindle.            Ways to tackle the infodemic            How could platforms rise to the occasion? Social-media companies must sort, rank, and prioritize true and reliable information now more than ever. Web companies             such as Pinterest            have already introduced headers and links on their homepages with information about Covid-19, for example.            But misinformation isn\u2019t just a problem of content; it\u2019s also one of transmission.             In desperate situations, government officials can activate emergency alert systems            across mobile phones, cable TV, and radio to reach the public. Today, however, no such emergency protocols exist for social media. As the WHO battles the coronavirus infodemic, what assurances does the public need that critical information is prioritized?            These emergency alert systems should include social platform companies, so that the transmission of critical information is possible. There are different ways to achieve this, but repurposing online advertising infrastructure to ensure that users get local, timely, and reliable information is just one way to meet this challenge. Platform companies also have a unique window into local behavior: they could help uncover needs in local communities and match people in need of food and medicine to neighborhood resources.            Importantly, there is no perfect communication delivery system, which means we must use all of them to send the same messages to the public. This is the only way to keep rumors from filling the void left by unanswered questions.            Our democracy\u2014and our lives\u2014depend on it.

They also found associations that we would recognize today as stereotypes: female names are more likely to be associated with family than careers or with arts rather than sciences. And the biased associations they uncovered mapped onto real-world discrimination. Previous research had found that US job candidates with traditionally European-American names were 50% more likely to get job interviews. They were able to replicate that finding, using just the fact that European-American names were more closely related to pleasant words in their data.             These were disturbing revelations for AI. But the researchers\u2019 point was to start a conversation about bias not just in algorithms but in humans. Because prejudice is a human trait, which is dependent on cultural norms and an individual\u2019s actions, addressing bias in AI is not solely a technical challenge.

Warehouse workers in Spain and Italy have tested positive for the virus, while workers in New York and Chicago told The Washington Post that Amazon isn\u2019t taking enough precautions as orders mount. Some said workers were sent home only after they had coughs, and signs were posted advising workers to wash their hands.           But in interviews, warehouse workers in the United States and Europe say they worry their workplaces aren\u2019t safe enough and could contribute to the spread of the virus. More than 1,500 workers from around the world have signed a petition that calls on the company to take additional steps to ensure the safety in their workplace.            AD            AD           A worker at one of the facilities in Spain, where some colleagues have been quarantined with coronavirus-like symptoms and two others have tested positive for covid-19, told The Post he fears the warehouse may be a hot spot and wants it shut down.           \u201cIt\u2019s an atmosphere of fear \u2014 huge fear right now,\u201d said Luismi Ruiz, who has worked there since November 2012 and is a union representative. Amazon is spraying disinfectant throughout the warehouse and staggering employee breaks so fewer people congregate together, to reduce contagion.           \u201cThese measures are totally insufficient,\u201d Ruiz added.

Business Add to list Purell prices are spiking on Amazon, as sanitizer speculation becomes a cottage industry           Amazon says it\u2019s taking appropriate precautions to protect workers. The company says it\u2019s following guidance from health officials regarding the operation of its facilities. And it provides workers time to use the restrooms to wash their hands.            AD            AD           \u201cWe are going to great lengths to keep the buildings extremely clean and help employees practice important precautions such as social distancing and other measures,\u201d Amazon spokeswoman Kelly Cheeseman said. \u201cThose who don\u2019t want to come to work are welcome to use paid and unpaid time off options and we support them in doing so.\u201d           (Amazon chief executive Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post.)           Any disruption to Amazon\u2019s ability to deliver goods could affect countless customers, who have turned to the company in recent days to bring canned food, cleaning supplies and more to their homes so they don\u2019t need to venture out to physical retailers and potentially spread the virus. Shoppers have turned to Amazon so frequently since the outbreak of the virus that the company has acknowledged it\u2019s out of stock of some household staples, and its deliveries are taking longer than usual.            AD            AD           It may not just be workers\u2019 safety at stake.            Recent research shows           the coronavirus can potentially remain viable \u2014 capable of infecting a person \u2014 for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel, though covid-19 has primarily spread through direct person-to-person contact.           Amazon has long had a contentious relationship with some warehouse workers, who have helped fuel its rapid growth. For years, the company, which has nearly 800,000 workers worldwide, most of whom work in its warehouses, has been criticized for what some employees describe as poor working conditions, insufficient bathroom breaks and tough goals. They\u2019ve also complained of the company\u2019s efforts to squash unionization. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) has denounced the company for paying subsistence wages to its warehouse staff.           Following criticism, the company raised            its minimum wage           to $15 an hour in 2018 and has implemented other changes to improve working conditions.            AD            AD           Now, workers are calling on the company to better protect them from a virus that\u2019s raced through the country and led several major retailers, including Apple, Patagonia and Nike, to temporarily shut their physical stores to contain the coronavirus.           At a New York delivery center, Jonathan Bailey, a sortation associate, said pressure from Amazon to meet the rate at which it wants workers to fulfill orders could lead workers to ignore safe sanitary practices. If Bailey and his colleagues don\u2019t \u201cmake rate,\u201d managers can write that up, a blemish on their record that can make it difficult to advance at the company and can even lead to firings, Bailey said.            Long lines, low supplies: Coronavirus chaos sends shoppers into panic-buying mode           So even though Amazon is encouraging workers to wash their hands, it\u2019s not giving them enough time to do so, Bailey said. The nearest bathroom is a two- to three-minute walk in each direction, reducing the amount of time he and his colleagues have to meet company shipping expectations, he said.            AD            AD           \u201cIf a worker is to cough or sneeze, there is no way for them to practice good sanitary habits\u201d and run to a restroom to wash hands, said Bailey, who has worked for Amazon since last summer. \u201cIt\u2019s going to affect your stow rate.\u201d           That\u2019s one reason the worker petition calls for eliminating rate-based write-ups. The petition also demands the company provide paid sick leave even if workers don\u2019t have a covid-19 diagnosis because testing remains difficult to get. And it seeks to make sure warehouses are shut if a worker tests positive for covid-19 and not reopened until they\u2019ve been thoroughly cleaned.           To alleviate that strain, Amazon            announced plans           Monday to hire 100,000 new warehouse workers in the United States. And the company intends to raise pay by $2 an hour in the U.S., 2 pounds an hour in the UK, and approximately 2 euro an hour in parts of the European Union, a move it expects will cost $350 million.            AD            AD           Amazon made a specific pitch to workers who have been furloughed by current employers who have suspended operations.           \u201cWe want those people to know we welcome them on our teams until things return to normal and their past employer is able to bring them back,\u201d Dave Clark, senior vice president of worldwide operations, wrote in a blog post.           The additional jobs come amid growing concern about low-wage workers not having job protections to stay at home or get health coverage if they come down with the virus.           The spread of the virus is particularly acute in Europe, as is the concern among Amazon warehouse workers there. The company has added workers in Italy recently to meet increased demand, according to Matteo Rossi, who works for Transnational Social Strike, which is trying to organize Amazon workers. He worries that could make social distancing, crucial to helping stop the spread of the disease, more difficult.            AD            AD           \u201cAmazon warehouses are more crowded than before,\u201d Rossi said.           Amazon confirmed that three workers at warehouses outside Madrid and Barcelona tested positive for covid-19, according to            a report from the Spanish news site           La Informaci\u00f3n.            Gig workers face the spread of the new coronavirus with no safety net           A worker at an Italian warehouse in Torrazza also            tested positive for the disease           , and workers there are also concerned about returning to the facility, according a report from the Italian news site La Stampa. Workers            declared a strike           Monday at a warehouse in Piacenza over concerns about containing the spread of the virus, La Stampa reported.           Christian Kraehling worries about meetings at the start of every shift, where his colleagues at a warehouse in Bad Hersfeld, Germany, are reminded of safety precautions such as using handrails when going downstairs. Those meetings include scores of workers standing shoulder to shoulder.           \u201cIt\u2019s a very bad situation with the coronavirus,\u201d said Kraehling, who has worked for Amazon for 10 years.

The parking lot was deserted, there was no breakfast being served in the cafeteria, and the nap rooms were tagged with signs announcing their closure \u201cas a precaution given the Covid-19 situation\u201d. \u201cThe office is so empty,\u201d he told me. \u201cEven more so than when the Googlers have their ski trip.\u201d         The day before, Google had asked all its North American employees to begin working from home due to the coronavirus \u2013 a          policy         that has since been expanded to the rest of its global workforce. But Borden, a triage analyst who has worked for Google for about four years, is one of the approximately 135,000 people who make up Google\u2019s \u201c          extended workforce         \u201d: temps and subcontractors who perform work for, but are not technically employed by, the $830bn company. And though Borden and his co-workers perform computer-based tasks that could just as easily be completed from home as those of other technical workers, Google does not allow them to access their work from home.         \u201cThe FTEs [full-time employees] almost all seem to be heeding the recommendation to work from home, while we are sitting here in the Petri dish, with the choice of not getting paid, or maybe getting sick and then putting our family and friends at risk too,\u201d Borden said. \u201cI\u2019ve heard from multiple people that they feel like we\u2019ve been forgotten and abandoned \u2013 and that our health and safety is clearly less important than the Googlers\u2019.         \u201cOur second-class status now has literal health implications,\u201d he added.         In many ways, the technology industry has been ahead of the curve in responding to the coronavirus pandemic. Facebook and Google were quick off the mark in          cancelling conferences         , and the industry has for the most part adapted quickly to the global imperative for social distancing by          encouraging employees         to work from home.         And it\u2019s not only the higher-paid technical workers who are being considered. Microsoft was the first to          commit         to paying hourly workers such as shuttle drivers and food service workers, even if their work hours are reduced as a result of the disease, a policy that was then          adopted         by other companies. Gig economy companies such as Uber and Lyft have announced plans to          fund 14 days of sick leave         for drivers who are diagnosed with Covid-19 or placed under quarantine. Amazon initially announced that it would          not penalize         warehouse workers for taking unpaid time off if they were sick during the month of March. On Wednesday, it announced a new policy that will provide paid sick leave for all employees affected by the coronavirus, according to the          Wall Street Journal             Mike Bloomberg\u2019s campaign is polluting the internet | Julia Carrie Wong             Read more         But why did it take a global pandemic for Amazon to consider that a policy that          penalizes         workers for taking          unpaid         time off          when they are          sick         is fundamentally inhumane? Why is it still acceptable to put in place protective measures for some part of the workforce, but not for all? And when this outbreak \u2013 and the accompanying public pressure \u2013 subsides, will          Amazon         , Uber, Lyft and others go right back to the previous system of forcing the lowest-paid members of their workforces to either work while sick or go without pay?         The situation recalled to me the work of Jacob Remes, a history professor at New York University who studies disasters. Several years ago, when I          interviewed         Remes about homelessness, he told me: \u201cWhat the category of disaster does is sort people into worthy poor and unworthy poor.\u201d In America, if you are made homeless by a hurricane, you are considered \u201cworthy\u201d and are (usually) eligible for public relief or support. But if you are homeless due to job loss or eviction, you are generally viewed as unworthy \u2013 and scorned by politicians as a sponge on the system.         Coronavirus is now creating a new division \u2013 between the worthy sick and the unworthy sick.         \u201cBecause there is suddenly more generosity during a disaster, there\u2019s also a lot more policing to make sure that the \u2018bad poor\u2019 don\u2019t get any benefit,\u201d Remes told me on Wednesday.         Why should          Uber         drivers and Amazon warehouse workers with a diagnosis of coronavirus be eligible for paid sick leave, but those with a diagnosis of cancer not be? And what does it say about our society that this sorting is acceptable?         \u201cDisasters really show both the positive and the negative things that we have built into society, because they demonstrate who is vulnerable and who is less vulnerable,\u201d Remes told me on Wednesday. \u201cAnd vulnerability is socially created.\u201d         The coronavirus pandemic has shone an unforgiving light on the social architecture that has both contributed to the tech industry\u2019s incredible wealth \u2013 and allowed large numbers of people to be left vulnerable. That workers like those in Google\u2019s Pittsburgh office are falling through the cracks is no accident \u2013 their vulnerability is part of the incredibly lucrative design.         A spokeswoman for Google said that some employees and contractors were still asked to come into the office \u201cto serve our users and keep our products running\u201d by performing work that \u201ccan only be done by people physically present at offices\u201d. She also noted that Google was taking \u201cnecessary and recommended precautions, including increased sanitization and social distancing\u201d.         But Borden questioned whether his co-workers\u2019 presence at the office was really necessary, noting that his work is entirely computer-based, and he simply lacks permission from Google to access it from home. Couldn\u2019t a company with more than $100bn in cash on hand simply pay for subcontractors to take a paid day off while Google sorts out the security protocols necessary to provide them with remote access? I asked.         \u201cMaybe this shows how much they really need us,\u201d Borden responded. \u201cOr, maybe it just shows how little they care.\u201d          Topics             Coronavirus outbreak             Dispatches from Silicon Valley             Google             Amazon             Uber             Microsoft             Lyft             comment              Share on Facebook              Share on Twitter              Share via Email              Share on LinkedIn              Share on Pinterest              Share on WhatsApp              Share on Messenger              Reuse this content         Most popular         Coronavirus         World         UK         Environment         Science         Global development         Football         Tech         Business         Obituaries        News        Opinion        Sport        Culture        Lifestyle         Contact us         Complaints &amp; corrections         SecureDrop         Work for us         Privacy policy         Cookie policy         Terms &amp; conditions         Help         All topics         All writers         Digital newspaper archive         Facebook         Twitter         Advertise with us         Search UK jobs         Dating         Discount Codes         Support The\u00a0Guardian         Available for everyone, funded by readers        Contribute        Subscribe       Back to top      \u00a9 2020 Guardian News &amp; Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

With millions of people working and learning from home during the pandemic, internet networks are set to be strained to the hilt.               <picture>                <span>                 <span>                  Pete Gamlen               By                 Davey Alba               and                 Cecilia Kang                Published                March 16, 2020                Updated                March 18, 2020             Derek Pando rarely had problems with his home internet service \u2014 until last week. That was when he began working from his house because of the coronavirus.             Mr. Pando, 35, a tech worker in Palo Alto, Calif., immediately started using work applications like video conferencing that ate up a lot of data. And he shared his internet service \u2014 which was built atop a premium broadband internet package from Comcast and a state-of-the-art home Wi-Fi network \u2014 with his wife, who was also working at home, and their two children, who at times streamed movies.             After five days of this activity, his internet ground to a halt, Mr. Pando said. Google Docs froze, and he couldn\u2019t get on video calls or send big email attachments. \u201cIt\u2019s never gotten that bad,\u201d he said.             As millions of people across the United States shift to working and              learning             from home this week to limit the spread of the coronavirus, they will test internet networks with one of the biggest mass behavior changes that the nation has experienced.             That is set to strain the internet\u2019s underlying infrastructure, with the burden likely to be particularly felt in two areas: the home networks that people have set up in their residences, and the home internet services from Comcast, Charter and Verizon that those home networks rely on.             That infrastructure is generally accustomed to certain peaks of activity at specific times of the day, such as in the evening when people return from work and get online at home. But the vast transfer of work and learning to people\u2019s homes will show new heights of internet use, with many users sharing the same internet connections throughout the day and using data-hungry apps that are usually reserved for offices and schools.             That may challenge what are known as last-mile services, which are the cable broadband and fiber-based broadband services that pipe the internet into homes. These tend to provide a very different internet service from what\u2019s available in offices and schools, which typically have \u201centerprise grade\u201d internet broadband service. In broad terms, many offices and schools essentially have the equivalent of a big pipe to carry internet traffic, compared with a garden hose for most homes.             On top of that, home networks \u2014 such as the Wi-Fi routers that residents set up \u2014 can be finicky. Many consumers have broadband plans with much lower capacity than in the workplace. And when many people are loaded onto a single Wi-Fi network at the same time to stream movies or to do video conferencing, that can cause congestion and slowness.             \u201cWe just don\u2019t know\u201d how the infrastructure will fare, said Tom Wheeler, a former chairman of the Federal Communications Commission. \u201cWhat is sufficient bandwidth for a couple of home computers for a husband and wife may not be sufficient when you add students who are going to class all day long operating from home.\u201d             Use of bandwidth-hogging apps and games has already shot up in places where the coronavirus has taken hold. In Italy, housebound youngsters playing PC games in large part pushed up internet traffic over one local landline network, Telecom Italia SpA, more than 90 percent compared with traffic in February, said Francesca Valagussa, a company spokeswoman. And in parts of Europe last week, traffic to WebEx, a videoconferencing service run by Cisco, soared as much as 80 percent, the company said.             In Seattle, which has been a center of the virus outbreak in the United States, internet traffic started spiking on Jan. 30, nine days after the first positive case of the virus in the area with people accessing news and using chat apps, according to security company Cloudflare. Last week, overall internet traffic in Seattle rose 30 percent compared with a normal week for the city in January.             Cogent Communications and Zayo, which provide internet services to big companies and municipalities, said they had also seen recent spikes in traffic from banks, retailers and tech companies in the United States to their remote employees.             In response, Verizon, Charter, Cox, Comcast and AT&amp;T said they were confident they could meet the demands placed on their home internet services, which includes cable broadband like Xfinity, fiber-based broadband like FIOS, mobile LTE services from Verizon and AT&amp;T, and Wi-Fi hot spots. They added that they were taking measures to help people who were working and learning from home.              Cox said             last week that it would automatically upgrade users of its basic broadband internet package, with speeds of 30 megabits per second, to a package with 50 megabits per second. That could help people deal with a rise in internet use and apps that require faster speeds and more bandwidth.              Comcast said             that for the next two months, it would lift data caps that limit broadband use so that people who surpassed the limits of their data plans wouldn\u2019t be penalized.             AT&amp;T, Verizon and Charter said they were also preparing to increase capacity on their networks if needed, with more equipment to upgrade networks and emergency roll-in cell towers that are used to keep people online during natural disasters.             \u201cVerizon operates its networks every day as though it\u2019s a snow day,\u201d said Kyle Malady, Verizon\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cDelivering reliable networks is what we do.\u201d             On Friday, Ajit Pai, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also introduced the              Keep Americans Connected Pledge             , whose dozens of signatories include Altice USA, CenturyLink and Sprint. They committed to not penalize Americans with termination of internet service or fees if people delayed their internet service payments, at least for the next two months.             Jon Peha, a professor of electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief technology officer of the F.C.C., said he was grappling with how to conduct online lectures from his Pittsburgh home because the campus had shut down in the face of the virus.             Because Mr. Peha was nervous about his cable broadband provider\u2019s ability to handle the intensity of services like video conferencing, which requires constant back-and-forth transfers of data packets with no interruptions from broadband congestion, he said he was considering upgrading his internet service.             He said the entirety of the internet infrastructure \u2014 home networks, last-mile services, private networks run by companies, the points of interchange between networks and the backbone superhighway at the core \u2014 would be stress-tested in coming days.             \u201cLives depend on reducing face-to-face interaction. and the internet is perfect for that,\u201d Mr. Peha said. \u201cBut there is a risk that usage will surge and capacity will be inadequate and performance will suffer. This is new ground for all of us.\u201d             As for Mr. Pando, he tried various ways to get his internet service to speed up.             First, he turned off other devices in the home that were connected to his Wi-Fi network and made sure his wife and children weren\u2019t online at the same time. Then he took a 75-foot Ethernet cable, which could feed his home broadband service directly into a device, and wrapped it around the home from the living room router to plug directly into his laptop.             It helped \u2014 but only a little.             On Friday, Mr. Pando got an email from Comcast saying it would soon increase bandwidth to help meet the greater demands from customers who were working from home.             \u201cIt\u2019s good to know they\u2019re worried, too,\u201d he said.

The sudden increase in working from home is presenting problems as well as opportunities: on the one hand, startups such as Slack and Zoom and established giants including Google and          Microsoft         are offering their tools for free, in the hope that people who start using them in a crisis may carry on once normality returns.         On the other hand, some systems are already creaking at the edges. Corporate networks, unused to having a majority of their connections coming in over virtual private networks (VPNs), are experiencing unusual quirks, while internet service providers have come under pressure to lift bandwidth caps so that remote workers do not get cut off from their employers halfway through the month.         But it looks increasingly as if the situation will not ever go back to how it was: many employees for companies who have sent all staff home are already starting to question why they had to go in to the office in the first place.         Large technology firms were some of the first to make the switch to remote working for all their staff, building on pre-existing infrastructure such as office chat groups, remote access to critical tools, and the fact that much knowledge work can be carried out remotely.         In Seattle, the hub of many of America\u2019s early Covid-19 cases, companies including Amazon, LinkedIn, Microsoft and          Google advised workers to stop coming in to the office         in late February. In early March, Twitter \u201cstrongly advised\u201d all its employees worldwide to do the same, and on Wednesday, made it compulsory.         \u201cWe understand this is an unprecedented step, but these are unprecedented times,\u201d Twitter\u2019s head of HR, Jennifer Christie, said in a message to staff. Christie promised to reimburse employees, including hourly workers, for the expenses required to set up home offices, covering the costs of buying things such as computer hardware, desks and ergonomic chairs. \u201cOverall, working from home doesn\u2019t change your day-to-day work, it just means you\u2019ll be doing it from a different environment,\u201d Christie added.         Those sorts of investments have prompted many to wonder if companies that embrace remote working in a crisis may find it sticks around as normality returns. It is harder to say no to employee requests for working from home if HR has already bought them a new desk \u2013 and it is easier to view the investment as a sensible one if it pays off for years, rather than months, to come.         \u201cThis is not how I envisioned the distributed work revolution taking hold,\u201d          said          Matt Mullenweg         , chief executive of WordPress and Tumblr owner Automattic. Mullenweg\u2019s company is already \u201cdistributed\u201d, and he predicts the changes \u201cmight also offer an opportunity for many companies to finally build a culture that allows long-overdue work flexibility.         \u201cMillions of people will get the chance to experience days without long commutes, or the harsh inflexibility of not being able to stay close to home when a family member is sick\u2026 This might be a chance for a great reset in terms of how we work,\u201d he said.         That\u2019s certainly what the industry behind remote work is hoping. \u201cWe are fully prepared for this situation,\u201d said a spokesperson for Slack, which makes popular business chat software. \u201cFirst and foremost, our concern is for the families and individuals affected by the coronavirus.         \u201cFor now, we are focused on helping people around the world adapt to remote work with          free resources         . For example, we have been hosting free consultations for companies adapting to remote work for the first time. We\u2019ve been speaking to companies of all sizes and from all industries \u2013 from large enterprises with hundreds of thousands of employees, to small businesses with a team of five.\u201d         Slack isn\u2019t alone. Microsoft has made its cloud \u201cproductivity suite\u201d free to small businesses for the next six months, including its Slack competitor, Teams.          Google         followed suit with its own business subscription, while videoconferencing service Zoom has lifted limitations on its own free tier, allowing conversations to exceed 40 minutes.             The art of Skype set-dressing: how to video-call the office when in quarantine | Imogen West-Knights             Read more         But for every company smoothly moving to the future of remote working, others have hit problems. Some have been comparatively minor: Facebook employees found their corporate network was banned from the takeaway service DoorDash for suspicious behaviour, as the company\u2019s entire workforce began placing orders for delivery all over the Bay Area in California while logged in to a VPN connecting from the same IP address.         Others have been more serious. An early fear that home broadband networks would collapse under the weight of usage was quelled by UK service providers, whose trade body, ISPA, pointed out that evening peak activity, when the nation sits down to stream Netflix and play online video games, is often 10 times the typical daytime demand.         More pressing is the fact that internet usage in general is increasing across the board. Cloudflare, which provides online infrastructure that underpins a huge swathe of the internet, says it has been tracking the increase.          Its chief executive,          Matthew Prince          , says         that \u201cas more people work from home, peak traffic in impacted regions has increased, on average, approximately 10%. In Italy, which has imposed a nationwide quarantine, peak internet traffic is up 30%. Traffic patterns have also shifted so peak traffic is occurring earlier in the day in impacted regions.\u201d         The real problems start when schools get suspended. Usage of Italy\u2019s national network has surged by more than two-thirds, not due to working from home, but due to housebound schoolchildren logging on to games such as Fortnite, according to a report          from Bloomberg News         Spikes in usage are most likely to affect people who pay for their internet with bandwidth caps, particularly common in the US and among those who rely on mobile broadband. Some American ISPs, including AT&amp;T, have          started suspending the practice         in order to avoid being blamed for preventing work, but not everyone has done so.         Still, technology can only go so far, and working from home is not for everyone. \u201cI\u2019ve worked 100% remote before,\u201d said one tech industry worker who has been sent home, \u201cand there comes a point where even an introvert would like to see another human.\u201d          Tools for remote working          Slack          Slack         , the \u00fcber workplace management tool, is loved and loathed in equal measure, but one thing it has going for it is its free-to-play business model: rather than needing to sign up the entire organisation at once, it is easy for individual teams, desks and offices to get started with the free tier, and expand as they see fit. That means it is best placed to help home workers quickly recreate the sort of in-person chat they had in the office.          Trello         Where Slack recreates the feeling of turning to a colleague for a quick chat that\u2019s as much personal as professional,          Trello         is more like your boss walking over to \u201cjust check on how you\u2019re doing\u201d. The project management software lets teams arrange and assign tasks, track wider project progress, and build workflows for repeated jobs \u2013 perfect for day four or five of working from home, when you might start to wonder if your boss has forgotten you exist.          Zoom         Videoconferencing tools are 10 a penny, but          Zoom         has impressed many by ironing out the kinks in an often-frustrating process. The app lifted its limit on free accounts as a response to the crisis, and theoretically supports up to 1,000 participants in a single meeting, though it\u2019s unclear whether that\u2019s actually a positive. The company has had some controversies, however, from an          insecure plugin for Mac clients         that was fixed in June to a questionable \u201cattention tracking\u201d feature that allows horrible bosses to use AI to check whether their employees are actually looking at the screen.          Tomates         Just as important as making sure you work well at home is making sure you take breaks from work at home. The Pomodoro method, a well-known approach to focus management that lets you break the day into 20-minute chunks with five-minute rests, is one such approach.          Tomates         , a simple and cheap Mac app, helps you to automate those timers \u2013 although any similar app will work too, or a simple physical timer like the tomato alarms the method is named after.

This applies to workers in all sectors, and even more intensely with           activities related to care          . If the right to work safely cannot be guaranteed, all nonessential activities must be shut down. Workers should not be forced to choose between their health and their livelihood. Yet Italian workers are losing their jobs, putting their loved ones at risk, protesting workplace health and safety conditions, and even self-organising to make up for the lack of state intervention. In this article, we try to document the main takeaways from the early weeks of the Italian crisis, hoping these will be useful resources for workers in other countries currently moving towards an intensified crisis.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"9e97\">           Keeping your job         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"5e41\">          Workers need to ensure they will not lose their paycheques. First and foremost, this requires that all workers have the ability to decide to stay at home when they show symptoms or feel unsafe. The immediate introduction of policies granting workers fourteen sick days at full pay \u2014 with no doctor\u2019s note requirement \u2014 must happen           now          at a mass scale. In Italy, the crisis exposed the most vulnerable workers to the loss of their jobs: precarious workers in sectors such as social work or restaurants lost their jobs overnight. This has worsened the danger generated by the attriting           of sick pay rights for Europe\u2019s workers since the financial crisis          . There are simply no safety nets for freelancers, contract workers and casual employees. The decree issued by the government on March 16 allocates a one-time 600 Euros to freelancers who lost their income due to the crisis. This is not enough. Self-employed workers have achieved a suspension of income taxes, a measure that will also apply to big and small companies. Italian workers are demanding a moratorium for layoffs. Italian social movements are asking for           an extension of basic income          to all temporary workers and freelancers. In Canada, for example, this would translate into an immediate extension of employment insurance across the board for all workers.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"3716\">          The mandate to work from home has been easy to implement. Companies tend to dislike it, assuming workers will use it to slack off, however its massive application during this crisis has shown this is not the case, as companies have managed to shift to online work without major problems. But online work has its dark sides. There is a class dimension to it, as blue-collar factory workers and pink-collar care workers cannot work from home like white-collar office workers and professionals. Furthermore, freelancers and workers in the creative industries have known for years that digital technology has the potential to extend the workplace to one\u2019s home and to make us work around the clock. Italian workers have reported that some employers use remote work to ask employees to carry out tasks overnight or on weekends. And a person working from home may have others\u2019 care needs to attend to, especially if they are responsible for children who are also home due to school closures or if their circumstances require they provide primary care for elderly or people with disabilities         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"8291\">           Caring for each other         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"23aa\">          Closing schools generates the obvious problem of care for children at home. In Italy,           grandparents have been mobilised          to step in for parents who had to keep working. This increased the risk of exposure to the virus in the most problematic demographic: the country\u2019s seniors. In many other cases, a parent (           the mother          in virtually all cases) has to make           a tough call          : could they renounce their part-time or casual low-income jobs to provide care for their children? The disabled, non-autonomous elderly, immunosuppressed people or those who require routine care for pre-existing conditions need augmented support at home too. Working families have demanded special parental leaves and increased support for those who employ personal caregivers. Workers cannot be asked to simply use their vacations to take care of their families. Undocumented labourers and no-income communities are just unable to choose.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"4126\">           Women are disproportionally impacted          by the crisis. Care workers, at least in the most-affected areas in Italy, tend to be mostly female people of colour and migrants. Their jobs put them at higher risk than the general population, and many have care responsibilities at home too. Furthermore, care workers are under extreme stress: babysitters, home healthcare providers, domestic workers, tend to be employed casually and may not have access to paid sick leave despite being placed at greater risk by their work. For another example of a high-risk population, social workers are especially overexposed to the virus. According to local social cooperatives in Lombardy (the hardest hit region),           up to 30% of social workers          are currently sick or quarantined. This directly impacts not only the workers\u2019 lives, but also the vulnerable beneficiaries they serve, which in turn increases pressure on their families or leaves them with no care at all. In the long run, this puts the entire social system under stress, above and beyond a welfare system already weakened by austerity measures.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"2c57\">           Mitigating risk         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"5392\">          The need to mitigate risk for those who must keep working is paramount. This means adopting measures for social distancing in workplaces whenever possible. In the event it is not, personal protection such as face masks, hand sanitizer, disinfectant, hand soap and paper towel must be made widely available to workers. But this is not a viable strategy in all workplaces. For instance, cleaners tend to work for small companies that provide services to bigger organisations, like public offices, firms and hospitals. In addition, the intensification of their use of detergents and disinfectants, coupled with the lack of protective equipment and the increased hours they are working with harmful inhalants and large amounts of other toxic chemicals, are putting these workers at much greater risk.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"b602\">          Worker power has proven key in fighting such situations. Italy is currently shaken by           a wave of wildcat strikes          in           factories          , warehouses,           supermarkets          , and ports. Workers in industries that have not been shut down, such as manufacturing or logistics, are protesting the impossibility to maintain social distancing in the workplace or the reckless disinterest shown by their employers. This is particularly crucial in sectors that may increase business in the event of a widespread lockdown, such as e-commerce or home-delivery services. Italian metalworkers, organised by unions such as           USB          and           FIOM          , are at the forefront of these struggles. In some cases, stoppings or protests have bypassed unions, as workers have decided not to wait for bargaining procedures to take place.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"3bbc\">          For example, Amazon workers report tensions. For them, work rhythms have not decreased, as self-isolated customers ramp up their online shopping. Amazon fulfillment centres are some of the most densely crowded workplaces in the Western hemisphere. The company\u2019s warehouses employ hundreds of workers per shift and require continuous physical co-presence and proximity to operate.           A petition          launched in a New York fulfillment centre has quickly spread to Italy, while unions have been questioning the need for Amazon to keep operating at full capacity. This raises the question of what constitutes an essential economic activity? In a viral video circulating via WhatsApp, a delivery worker for Amazon wearing surgical gloves and face mask says, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, you will still receive your fucking Hello Kitty iPhone cover!\u201d Should manufacturing plants and e-commerce warehouses           shut down          or at least dramatically reduce their activities? Thus far, this decision has been left to individual companies. The largest Amazon warehouse in the country is in the COVID-19 hotspot of Piacenza. On March 17, unions launched a strike under the banner \u201c           No Safety, No Work          ,\u201d denouncing the company\u2019s lack of compliance with the safety measures imposed by the government.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"41d9\">           Self-organising         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"e4ab\">          Workers have not been waiting for the state to respond to their needs or for unions to win concessions. Both individual refusal of unsafe work and collective self-organising are resurging at a level the country has not seen in decades. This includes absenteeism, tactical use of sick leaves, new forms of organising and grassroots social interventions. The scale of these phenomena has been increasing rapidly, especially in reaction to a number of government measures geared towards helping corporations rather than people. Several unions and workers report increased worker desertion, as people exploit any avenue they have to reduce their exposure to unsafe environments. Amazon warehouses in Italy and other European countries are seeing           hundreds of workers using sick leave          to avoid walking into an unsafe workplace.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"2540\">          These forms of individual resistance are not the only self-organised response. In Piacenza, one of the main coronavirus hotspots, the radical union SiCobas has swiftly launched a concerted effort to make up for the state\u2019s inability to provide health and safety to workers in specific critical areas. SiCobas organises the vast majority of warehouse workers in the massive local logistics sector. This organisation is purchasing, stockpiling, and           distributing personal protection equipment          , such as face masks, to Red Cross volunteers and workers in private care facilities who are dealing with shortages. Squats are offering grassroots care-work services, such as babysitting, tutoring, grocery shopping and delivery. Others have opened helplines to provide legal support to workers who have lost their jobs or are confronting health and safety issues at work. A number of grassroots organisations have popped up in Milan and other affected cities to help elderly, immunosuppressed or quarantined people deal with the lockdown by providing basic home care and delivering groceries or drugs.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"e980\">           The future is unwritten         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"f334\">          We do not know what the outcome of this crisis will be. COVID-19 infections are still mounting in Italy and many other countries are currently entering the phase Italy experienced only three weeks ago. Timeliness and organisation seem to be paramount if workers elsewhere want to avoid going through all the same dramatic problems experienced in Italy. But such a troubled situation has given workers a chance to renegotiate power relations. This applies across the board, from workplace democracy to wages, welfare, and obviously health and safety measures. Workers have been imagining universal solutions based on the radical redistribution of time, resources, money and power. This is the opposite of the temporary, partial and often unjust measures the state has patched up the crisis with. The right to a safe workplace, which is clearly key in the current state of emergency, should become a permanent condition of work everywhere. The future is unwritten, but many Italian workers hope that some of the radical imaginative solutions they have been forced to experiment with are here to stay.         <p class=\"hd he ap ce hf b hg hh hi hj hk hl hm hn ho hp hq dq\" id=\"7630\">          This article was written by Beatrice Busi, Alessandro Delfanti and Erika Biddle on March 17, 2020.

Each bubble on this chart represents an occupation. The bigger the bubble, the more people do that job.              The vertical position of each bubble is a measure of how often workers in a given profession are exposed to               disease and infection              .              The horizontal position is a measure of               how close              people are to others during their workdays.              Health care workers are at the greatest risk \u2014 they can encounter diseases and infections daily and typically work in close proximity to one another and their patients. Many are already               under quarantine              because of exposure to the virus.              Personal care aides and home health aides who work with the elderly \u2014 the population most susceptible to the illness \u2014 are also vulnerable. At a nursing home in Washington State               linked to              25 coronavirus deaths as of Saturday, at least 70 employees               have fallen sick              .              First responders are also at high risk. Firefighters who responded to calls at the Washington nursing home are under               extended quarantines              . Paramedics across the country are taking               extra precautions              when responding to a possible coronavirus case.              School systems around the country have been closing. Teachers rate high both for exposure to illnesses and for their proximity to other people.              The risk isn\u2019t limited to those on the front lines. Many people who do service jobs like cashiers and fast-food workers face elevated risks. Walmart, Starbucks and Uber are among               the many companies              that have had workers fall sick.              Workers in a number of professions facing elevated risk earn less than the national median wage. Many of these workers in low-paying jobs do not have paid sick leave, and many could still go to work               sick              to not lose income.              Hover over the bubbles to explore each profession, including how many people work in those jobs and what they earn.  \t\t// move header to new location         The risk levels of various jobs were calculated using          O*NET         , a database maintained by the Department of Labor that describes various physical aspects of different occupations. The database assigns dozens of scores to each occupation for things like how often          a telephone is used         to how often a job requires you to          bend your body         . (Housekeepers rank highest in this metric.)         As virus cases have grown, many businesses have begun closing offices and stores, and sending workers home to help slow the spread. While many companies have          emergency leave         policies in place to help protect their employees, there are large portions of the population that have few protections. On Saturday, legislators          passed         a relief package that includes paid sick leave for workers affected by the coronavirus. But the benefits only apply to employees of companies with fewer than 500 employees, leaving millions of workers uncovered.

In the Seattle area, one small catering company was forced to          let go         nearly all its employees because of cancellations from big tech clients.         A growing number of companies have also been asking employees to do their jobs from home. But that arrangement is largely available only to white-collar workers. For many occupations, working from home is simply not feasible, including those who are on the front lines of the response and those who are on the lower end of the economic scale.

In pursuit of this urgent and necessary task, many government agencies are collecting and analyzing personal information about large numbers of identifiable people, including their health, travel, and personal relationships. As our society struggles with how best to minimize the spread of this disease, we must carefully consider the way that \u201cbig data\u201d containment tools impact our digital liberties.               <span>                Special efforts by public health agencies to combat the spread of COVID-19 are warranted. In the digital world as in the physical world, public policy must reflect a balance between collective good and civil liberties in order to protect the health and safety of our society from communicable disease outbreaks. It is important, however, that any extraordinary measures used to manage a specific crisis must not become permanent fixtures in the landscape of government intrusions into daily life. There is historical precedent for life-saving programs such as these, and their intrusions on digital liberties, to outlive their urgency.               <span>                Thus, any data collection and digital monitoring of potential carriers of COVID-19 should take into consideration and commit to these principles:                 Privacy intrusions must be necessary and proportionate                <span>                 . A program that collects, en masse, identifiable information about people must be scientifically justified and deemed necessary by public health experts for the purpose of containment. And that data processing must be                 <span>                  proportionate to the need                <span>                 . For example, maintenance of 10 years of travel history of all people would not be proportionate to the need to contain a disease like COVID-19, which has a                 <span>                  two-week                <span>                 incubation period.                <span>                <span>                 Data collection based on science, not bias.                <span>                 Given the global scope of communicable diseases, there is historical precedent for                 <span>                  improper                 <span>                  government                 <span>                  containment                 <span>                  efforts                <span>                 driven by bias based on nationality, ethnicity, religion, and race\u2014rather than facts about a particular individual\u2019s actual likelihood of contracting the virus, such as their travel history or contact with potentially infected people. Today, we must ensure that any automated data systems used to contain COVID-19 do not erroneously identify members of specific demographic groups as particularly susceptible to infection.                <span>                <span>                 Expiration.                <span>                 As in other major emergencies in the past, there is a hazard that the data surveillance infrastructure we build to contain COVID-19 may long outlive the crisis it was intended to address. The government and its corporate cooperators must roll back any invasive programs created in the name of public health after crisis has been contained.                <span>                <span>                 Transparency.                <span>                 Any government use of \"big data\" to track virus spread must be clearly and quickly explained to the public. This includes publication of detailed information about the information being gathered, the retention period for the information, the tools used to process that information, the ways these tools guide public health decisions, and whether these tools have had any positive or negative outcomes.                <span>                <span>                 Due Process.                <span>                 If the government seeks to limit a person\u2019s rights based on this \"big data\" surveillance (for example, to quarantine them based on the system\u2019s conclusions about their relationships or travel), then the person must have the opportunity to timely and fairly challenge these conclusions and limits.               <span>                In light of these principles, we are troubled by                <span>                 reports                <span>                 about               <span>                how the Chinese government is using \u201cbig data\u201d to contain COVID-19. Reportedly, that government is requiring its citizens to download software to their phones, and then use their phones to scan QR codes when they arrive at checkpoints for entry to public spaces (e.g., trains and malls). This software assigns each citizen a color code (i.e., green, yellow, or red) to indicate their health status. The software dictates whether each citizen should be quarantined, and whether they may enter public spaces. The software also sends information to the local police. The Chinese government says it is only using this system to identify people who may be infected. Citizens report they have been quarantined because this tracking system identified contact between them and an infected person.               <span>                We also have questions about a                <span>                 new                <span>                 rule               <span>                from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). It requires airline companies to collect the name and contact information of all passengers and crew arriving in the United States on international flights, and to transmit this information to the CDC within 24 hours of an order to do so. The CDC intends to use this information for \u201ccontact tracing,\u201d that is, to rapidly identify people who were in contact with an infected person, so those contacted people can be timely notified, tested, and possibly quarantined. Such data processing may be necessary and proportionate to the public health need.               <span>                But we must not lose sight of the great sensitivity of the personal data at issue\u2013this                <span>                 data paints               <span>                a clear picture of the travel, health, and personal relationships of airline passengers. EFF would like the CDC to explain what it will do to ensure this sensitive data is used only to contain communicable diseases. For example, what measures will ensure this data is purged when no longer helpful to contact tracing? Also, what safeguards will ensure this newly collected data is not used by police for ordinary crime fighting, or by ICE for immigration enforcement?               <span>                EFF has long advocated against digital surveillance by government and corporations of our                <span>                 movements               <span>                ,                <span>                 health               <span>                , and                <span>                 personal relationships               <span>                , and against                <span>                 big                <span>                 data                <span>                 systems               <span>                that can turn our lives into open books. Such data processing often invades our privacy, deters our free speech and association, and disparately burdens racial minorities. Some use of big data may now be warranted as public health officials work to contain COVID-19. But it must be medically necessary, as determined by public health experts; any new processing of personal data must be proportionate to the actual need; people must not be scrutinized because of their nationality or other demographic factors; and any new government powers must expire when the disease is contained.

Justin Sullivan/Getty Images          Popular in           Technology            Please, Let\u2019s Stop the Epidemic of Armchair Epidemiology            Why Did Tech Companies Stockpile Millions of Medical Masks?            Whatever You Do During a Pandemic, Don\u2019t Get Hurt Doing Dumb Stuff            She Was Treating the Infected. Now She Has the Coronavirus.         On Friday, President Donald Trump declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. He then announced a surprising public-private partnership to make testing widely available. Federal agencies will collaborate with Target, Walmart, CVS, and Walgreens to offer drive-thru coronavirus testing in store parking lots.         Trump\u2019s next announcement was even more unexpected: Google would offer nationwide COVID-19 screening through an online          portal         that records people\u2019s symptoms, triages them to determine who requires drive-thru testing, and displays test results once they are available.         Immediately after the press conference, Google          clarified         the president\u2019s characterization of the website. Its sister company Verily, the health and life sciences division of parent company Alphabet, developed the portal, which went live Sunday evening. It would initially be available only for the San Francisco Bay Area. But Verily said that after piloting the program regionally, it plans to offer the portal throughout California and potentially nationwide. Some people who visited the site on Sunday and were given sufficiently high COVID-19 risk scores received appointments and were tested on Monday at one of two San Francisco Bay Area test centers, currently located in Santa Clara and San Mateo counties. Others were turned away when the available slots were filled, and a          waiting list         was formed. According to Verily, it will call people in the queue when new appointments become available.         But early confusion over the website\u2019s scope is not the only concern. Visitors must sign in with an existing Google account or create a new one, which requires providing a phone number. Once admitted, users are asked about their age, gender, travel history, health status, and contact with people who may have been exposed to the novel coronavirus. Based on those answers, the portal calculates a COVID-19 risk score.          Unless we act now, such systems will become          normalized.         Though accessible testing for the novel coronavirus is          essential         to slowing its spread, Americans should be suspicious of tech company involvement. When combined with drive-thru testing, Verily\u2019s portal may constitute the largest acquisition of U.S. health data by private companies to date. It is part of a broader trend in which public health functions, typically performed by government agencies, are increasingly shifted to corporations. Facebook\u2019s use of          artificial intelligence         to calculate          suicide risk         is another example. Developed with the Department of Veterans Affairs, the technology is now used primarily by Facebook and other private companies. (I discuss this and other examples in a new article, \u201c          Emergent Medical Data: Health Information Inferred by Artificial Intelligence         ,\u201d that is forthcoming in the UC\u2013Irvine Law Review.)         The privatization and automation of public health is concerning because it disrupts well-established flows of health data and circumvents legal safeguards around privacy. Through their public health projects, Facebook and Verily now serve as intermediaries between people and government agencies. Facebook mediates the flow of mental health information between its users and emergency responders, and now Verily controls the flow of COVID-19 screening data between some Americans and public health officials.         As COVID-19 spreads through our communities, stories abound of people exploiting the situation for financial gain. Unscrupulous pandemic          profiteers         horde protective gear and cleaning supplies to sell at exorbitant prices. Like these commodities, data siphoned by tech companies from COVID-19 screening may be the next asset to be hoarded and exploited.         Neither Google nor Verily is a health care provider. They owe users none of the duties that doctors owe to patients, and federal privacy laws, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, do not apply. That\u2019s a serious problem because companies can exploit people\u2019s data in surreptitious ways that violate their expectations and jeopardize their rights. Data might be shared with advertisers, sold to insurance companies, or used to calculate consumer          credit scores         that control access to resources.         In China, such scores determine whether people can have specific jobs, live in certain apartments, or access transportation. One of the best-known scores, called Sesame Credit, is provided by Alibaba through its smartphone payment app Alipay. Because of the COVID-19 outbreak, Chinese officials now reportedly          require         people to download an app called          Alipay Health Code         , which assigns them a color code (green, yellow, or red) that reflects their health status. A green code means they are healthy and free to travel, but yellow or red codes require them to report to authorities, and people with the latter codes may be barred from travel or even quarantined. Because Alipay and the Chinese government have not explained how the app classifies people, users can be quarantined without understanding why. While it may be extreme, this example illustrates how loss of autonomy, predictability, and accountability is part of the risk of automating public health.         Verily and Google declined to respond to Slate\u2019s questions about the portal and how it uses people\u2019s data. Though less coercive than Alipay\u2019s app\u2014its use is optional, for one thing\u2014the portal is equally mysterious. Today it controls access to testing in and around Silicon Valley, but the pandemic is rapidly evolving. After expanding to other regions, the portal could be adapted to track and control individuals who undergo testing and receive positive results.         There are other risks. During the AIDs epidemic of the 1980s, HIV-positive individuals were heavily stigmatized. It took decades of dedicated          advocacy         to reduce that stigma, and it still persists today. Even when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, individuals may be stigmatized by peers and co-workers. Some groups, such as          Asian Americans         , seniors, and health care workers, have already been subjected to pandemic-related          harassment         . Minimizing the unnecessary dissemination of COVID-19 data puts people in control of their health information and reduces the risk of discrimination.         Should we be willing to give up some privacy for the sake of public health? Of course. It is expected that some liberties may be curtailed during national emergencies (for instance, when the government implements a curfew or quarantine). But we cannot allow companies to use our urgent need for testing, and the distraction provided by the pandemic, to extract more data than is necessary to promote public health. Unless we act now, such systems will become normalized. It is urgent that we set clear limitations on how Google, Verily, and participating retailers can use COVID-19 screening data.         Verily\u2019s portal collects people\u2019s demographics, medical histories, and current symptoms to determine whether they require testing. At this stage, Google may harvest the data to supplement its growing cache of health information obtained through          partnerships         with dozens of hospitals and health care systems. It may also collect data on people\u2019s devices, locations, IP addresses, and other variables. Google could analyze that information to learn more about portal users and share insights with corporate partners such as          Salesforce         , a provider of business management software, and companies including DeepMind, a world leader in A.I. and data analytics.         If the screening portal directs people to undergo COVID-19 testing, they will visit a drive-thru location where their mouths and noses will be swabbed. Like Google and Facebook, the retail testing partners listed by Trump routinely collect data from consumers to profile them and influence their behavior.         According to Walmart\u2019s          privacy policy         , the company collects biometric information \u201csuch as imagery of the iris, retina, and fingerprints,\u201d geolocation information, audiovisual, and \u201cother sensory information.\u201d Some Walmart locations use devices called \u201cLot Cops\u201d to monitor parking areas. Manufactured by LiveView Technologies, they provide a 360-degree bird\u2019s-eye view of the area. LiveView recently partnered with          Rekor Systems         to integrate license plate reading technology into its Lot Cop units. People visiting drive-thru testing sites may unwittingly be tracked by these technologies.         Walgreens also deploys invasive surveillance technologies. According to its privacy policy, the company uses          Bluetooth beacons         , Wi-Fi, and other technologies to track people\u2019s movements. In 2019, it tested in-store \u201csmart coolers\u201d that scan people\u2019s faces to infer their age and gender while tracking their eyes to see which products attract their gaze.         Target uses Bluetooth and other technology to track people\u2019s movements, and it previously tested in-store biometrics including          facial recognition         . In 2012, the retailer made national news by predicting which customers were pregnant based on their shopping habits. It sent coupons for pregnancy and newborn-related products to customers\u2019 homes.         Because these companies scan people\u2019s bodies, observe their behavior, and use A.I. to infer information about their age, gender, sexuality, and health, collecting pandemic-related data is in their wheelhouse.         Representatives of Walmart, Walgreens, and Target declined to comment on how they will protect people\u2019s privacy during COVID-19 testing. However, CVS representative Joseph Goode said his company will not collect data from individuals who visit its drive-thrus. When asked what CVS will do to actively protect people\u2019s privacy, Goode said, \u201cThe [Trump] administration is working on those details.\u201d         I offer the following recommendations. The companies facilitating COVID-19 testing must make their data use practices completely transparent. They should be developing safe and reliable public health infrastructure, not proprietary trade secrets.         Verily should not require people to log in to a Google account or provide a phone number in order to be screened. This information is not essential for testing.         The screening portal should not collect device, location, or IP address data, and information collected must solely be used for screening and only be shared with public health officials. Under no circumstances should it be joined with data collected by Google\u2019s many other services or shared with business partners and sister companies.         Retailers offering drive-thru testing should suspend electronic surveillance including video, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, and other technologies.         In response to these suggestions, some might say it\u2019s rude to look a gift horse in the mouth. Google and Verily are volunteering time and resources to combat a pandemic. But it is not too much to ask for a government-run system. Canada\u2019s Alberta Health Services offers a screening          portal         that requires no login or personal information.         In general, private companies should not perform functions that are best reserved for scientists and public health agencies. Since we are in dire need of COVID-19 screening, perhaps Google and Verily can play a role in providing it, but the loss of our privacy should not be the cost.

Public-health experts are interested in the possibility that private-sector companies could compile the data in anonymous, aggregated form, which they could then use to map the spread of the infection, according to three people familiar with the effort, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the project is in its early stages.           Analyzing trends in smartphone owners\u2019 whereabouts could prove to be a powerful tool for health authorities looking to track coronavirus, which has infected more than 180,000 people globally. But it\u2019s also an approach that could leave some Americans uncomfortable, depending on how it\u2019s implemented, given the sensitivity when it comes to details of their daily whereabouts. Multiple sources stressed that \u2014 if they proceed \u2014 they are not building a government database.            AD            AD           In recent interviews, Facebook executives said the U.S. government is particularly interested in understanding patterns of people\u2019s movements, which can be derived through data the company collects from users who allow it. The tech giant in the past has provided this information to researchers in the form of statistics, which in the case of coronavirus, could help officials predict the next hotspot or decide where to allocate overstretched health resources.           Google also confirmed late Tuesday it had been in conversations with government officials, tech giants and health experts. The company says it is working on its own to tap its trove of location data, particularly any insights it can derive from its popular maps app.           \u201cWe\u2019re exploring ways that aggregated anonymized location information could help in the fight against COVID-19. One example could be helping health authorities determine the impact of social distancing, similar to the way we show popular restaurant times and traffic patterns in Google Maps,\u201d spokesman Johnny Luu said in a statement, stressing any such partnership \u201cwould not involve sharing data about any individual\u2019s location, movement, or contacts.\u201d            AD            AD            Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

At the White House, an official at the Office of Science and Technology Policy, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the government is \u201cencouraged by American technology companies looking to leverage aggregated, anonymized data to glean key insights for covid-19 modeling efforts.\u201d           The official added those insights might \u201chelp public health officials, researchers, and scientists improve their understanding of the spread of covid-19 and transmission of the disease.\u201d            Live updates: Coronavirus quarantines, lockdowns and closures upend life across the globe           A task force created by tech executives, entrepreneurs and investors presented a range of ideas around disease mapping and telehealth to the White House during a private meeting Sunday. The discussions included representatives from tech giants, including Apple and Google; investors led by the New York-based firm Hangar and well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalist Ron Conway; public-health leaders from Harvard University; and smaller telehealth start-ups like Ro, two people said.            AD            AD           \u201cWe are still in the process of collecting ideas, recommendations, and proposed actions from task-force members, which we intend to present to the White House in the coming days,\u201d said Josh Mendelsohn, the managing partner at Hangar, who helped organize the effort.           Many of those involved either did not respond or declined to comment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention did not respond to a request for comment. Apple said Tuesday it has only worked on issues related to telehealth and distance learning, stressing it doesn\u2019t collect iPhone users\u2019 locations.           The early, unprecedented collaboration between Washington and Silicon Valley reflects the urgent, nationwide scramble to stop a deadly malady that has            shuttered businesses           ,            skewered the stock market           ,            sent students home from school           and now threatens to overwhelm the U.S. medical system with patients in need of critical care.            AD            AD           Over the past week, White House officials led by Michael Kratsios, the country\u2019s chief technology officer, have convened meetings to            leverage the tech expertise of Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, IBM           and other technology leaders. The government has encouraged social-media sites to take a more aggressive approach to thwart coronavirus conspiracy theories, The Washington Post has reported, responding to concerns that            foreign misinformation might be stoking panic about the outbreak           . And the Trump administration has explored partnering with the tech industry to improve telework and telehealth offerings for millions of Americans.            White House asks Silicon Valley for help to combat coronavirus, track its spread and stop misinformation           The relationship hasn\u2019t been without its hiccups: On Friday, President Trump announced Google would be developing a website so Americans could learn how to get tested for coronavirus, which causes the disease covid-19. That            differed from the initial statements           from Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, which had indicated it planned a more limited offering targeting residents of California. Ultimately, though, Google said soon after it would unveil a website to provide information for U.S. patients nationwide.           On Monday, White House leaders, tech experts and health officials struck a more unified note, unveiling a portal for roughly 29,000 research papers on coronavirus. The portal allows the tech industry\u2019s artificial-intelligence tools \u2014 which can scan and analyze data en masse \u2014 to process the papers rapidly to uncover new insights about the global malady.            AD            AD           \u201cDecisive action from America\u2019s science and technology enterprise is critical to prevent, detect, treat, and develop solutions to COVID-19,\u201d Kratsios said in a statement.            \u2018It shouldn\u2019t take a pandemic\u2019: Coronavirus exposes Internet inequality among U.S. students as schools close their doors           The new efforts by Washington and Silicon Valley arrived the same week that dozens of engineers, executives and epidemiologists issued an open letter, calling on companies to take a greater stand against coronavirus. Specifically, they encouraged Apple and Google to adopt \u201cprivacy preserving\u201d features that might enable authorities to help doctors            determine people who were in contact           with a patient that later tested positive for coronavirus.           \u201cTechnology companies have taken important steps already, such as closing offices in affected areas or showing custom search results in place of user generated content. But we believe there is a lot more that Silicon Valley can do to assist with large scale mitigation,\u201d they wrote.            AD            AD           Smartphones regularly transmit their locations to wireless carriers and often to major tech companies as well, including Google and Facebook, to make some of their services work. The makers of apps that deliver weather reports, hail rides or help people find a coffee shop also frequently collect location information, and some sell it to firms that mine the data for business insights and opportunities.           Privacy advocates typically look skeptically on such commercial uses of location data, calling for stricter laws governing its use. Recent news about Israel\u2019s plans to use location data to help track the coronavirus similarly sparked intense discussions about the legal and ethical implications of deploying such data to thwart the spread of disease and get medical help to infected people.           \u201cThe balance between privacy and pandemic policy is a delicate one,\u201d Al Gidari, director of privacy at Stanford Law School\u2019s Center for Internet and Society, tweeted last week. \u201cThe problem here is that this is not a law school exam. Technology can save lives, but if the implementation unreasonably threatens privacy, more lives may be at risk.\u201d            AD            AD           The issues are all the more sensitive for Silicon Valley because the companies faced a severe backlash in 2013, following disclosures about the role of tech company data in surveillance by the National Security Agency, made public by agency contractor Edward Snowden. Relations between tech companies and government officials were severely strained for years after and have improved only gradually.           \u201cPrivacy is the first to go when there are national security issues,\u201d said Ashkan Soltani, a former Federal Trade Commission chief technologist who covered the Snowden revelations as a journalist.           In seeking to battle the coronavirus, the U.S. government is not seeking to collect and maintain a database of Americans\u2019 whereabouts, sources cautioned. Rather, U.S. officials have asked whether companies\u2019 vast stores of geolocation data might help epidemiologists spot trends, including vulnerable populations, or identify areas at risk, such as hospitals under strain, two people said.            AD            AD            State Department blames \u2018swarms of online, false personas\u2019 from Russia for wave of coronavirus misinformation online           Facebook is already working with health researchers and nonprofits in several countries to provide anonymized and aggregated statistics about people\u2019s movements through a project called disease-prevention maps.           Facebook populates its maps with the aid of its users, who have given the company permission to collect their location \u2014 harnessed via their smartphones \u2014 while its app runs in the background. Those locations are then aggregated and anonymized by Facebook engineers, who can calculate the likelihood people in one city or town are likely to visit another area, potentially spreading the outbreak there.           The most granular data Facebook provides to outsiders can locate a person to within about a third of a mile, Facebook officials say. The tech giant does not provide any data about individuals\u2019 movement, aggregated or otherwise, to governments for disease tracking, the company says.           \u201cYou\u2019re trying to predict the probability that a group of people in Prince George\u2019s County might interact with a group of people from D.C.,\u201d said Laura McGorman, who leads the project, referring to the Maryland county in suburban Washington. Such a prediction could offer clues for how infections might travel.           McGorman said government officials, including those in California, are also interested in seeing whether people are practicing social distancing and whether it is an effective strategy. She said engineers had labored over the past 48 hours to help authorities with their requests.           She said the project is in the early phases because it is challenging to map real-time location streaming in from smartphones against analog information coming in from hospitals and cities. \u201cIt is very humbling because we have one piece of the puzzle that we can offer but there are so many other inputs in understanding how disease will spread.\u201d           For its part, Google said Tuesday it had not shared any aggregated, anonymized data, stressing the project is still in its early stages \u2014 and that it was still considering whether to participate. The company added it did not plan to tap its cache of users\u2019 location information to help in so-called \u201ccontact tracing\u201d efforts to find people at risk of contracting coronavirus, explaining the data could not be adapted to help in that manner.

This new nonvolatile DIMM supports byte-granularity accesses with access times on the order of DRAM, while also providing data storage that survives power outages.            Researchers have not idly waited for real nonvolatile DIMMs (NVDIMMs) to arrive. Over the past decade, they have written a slew of papers proposing new programming models, file systems, libraries, and applications built to exploit the performance and flexibility that NVDIMMs promised to deliver. Those papers drew conclusions and made design decisions without detailed knowledge of how real NVDIMMs would behave or how industry would integrate them into computer architectures. Now that Optane NVDIMMs are actually here, we can provide detailed performance numbers, concrete guidance for programmers on these systems, reevaluate prior art for performance, and reoptimize persistent memory software for the real Optane DIMM.            In this paper, we explore the performance properties and characteristics of Intel\u2019s new Optane DIMM at the micro and macro level. First, we investigate the basic characteristics of the device, taking special note of the particular ways in which its performance is peculiar relative to traditional DRAM or other past methods used to emulate NVM. From these observations, we recommend a set of best practices to maximize the performance of the device. With our improved understanding, we then explore and reoptimize the performance of prior art in application-level software for persistent memory.

For some reason, we are attracted to single-figure summaries of quality, whether it\u2019s lines of code,      cyclomatic complexity     , or the      Pylint score     Personally, I think using these are about as valuable as judging another person based on one of their visible or measurable characteristics.     Which is to say, an okay metric might get the conversation started, but it won\u2019t help you      know     them. That takes time and effort, humility, seeking to understand their background, and changing your mind about previous assumptions when something about them challenges you.     Comparing measurements is also just as ridiculous with code as it is with people,      except     when measuring your own progress. If you know which direction is \u201cbetter\u201d, then you can tell whether a change moved in that direction.     In that light, my favourite metric for Python code is      area under the indent     (where less area is better).     This measurement (or estimate) captures both lines of code and nesting depth, which is more valid for Python than other languages because of Python\u2019s one-action-per-line style. With a reasonable length limit, you also prevent people packing extremely long expressions into one line to try and game the metric.     But that\u2019s not the point of this post.     Having a simple, comparable metric doesn\u2019t mean you will write better code. Knowing a person\u2019s gender, weight or 5km time doesn\u2019t mean you will respect them. Something more is required.     One thing I am often asked for by Python developers is recommended design patterns. Typically by ex-Java developers, who are used to having well written architectural idioms, and are thrown by Python\u2019s more relaxed approach.     In response, I don\u2019t offer them specific advice. I give them a simple question, which, applied anywhere throughout your entire codebase, leads to the most well designed code.     And as it happens, well-designed code fares well under most complexity metrics (except for \u201csource code bytes on disk\u201d, but those are cheap).     The question is this:      how am I going to test it?     How will I test it?     Different languages take different approaches to validating code correctness. Many start with static typing (C++) and some end there (Java). Others extend it further (Ada) and some even further (      SPARK     ), while some rely entirely on the skill of the developer (C).     Python has always relied on dynamic testing: to check whether your code is correct, you run it and see what it does!     This has huge value in terms of expressiveness. It enables duck-typing, metaclasses, and decorators, all of which are difficult or impossible to verify statically. It enables runtime code generation and import search path manipulation. It simplifies embedding into other applications. It enables a range of non-breaking API changes that would be fatal in other languages.     The cost is writing tests.     Thirty years ago, when Python was invented, I\u2019m sure this seemed an unnecessary burden. These days, engineering best practices recommend tests for all code, regardless of language.     But rather than being a burden, writing tests for dynamic code is actually the best way to ensure your architecture is well designed. Not because the tests themselves are magic, but because they interact with your source code from a perspective that essentially forces you into good design.     Well Designed Architectures     To set some context, here are a few of my characteristics of well-designed architectures. (You may disagree with these, in which case I will assume you have poorly designed software.)      Easy to navigate      You can easily find a piece of code based on knowing what it does      Easy to modify      You can easily change a piece of code without impacting things that use it      Easy to identify side effects      You can easily tell whether a piece of code requires/modifies external state      Easy to avoid side effects      You can use part of your code and deliberately bypass any external impact     The following sections will briefly describe what I mean by these characteristics, and suggest how writing tests will help you achieve them.     There\u2019s a noticeable lack of code examples, because I\u2019m not trying to      teach     anything here, merely to provoke deep(er) thoughts. With a bit of luck, some readers will find themselves inspired to take these ideas and present them in a form that\u2019s accessible to more people. For example,      Cosmic Python      TDDwP     ) got here      years     ahead of me, and has fantastic books and blogs that get into details about architectures that serve the developer (and not the developer\u2019s ego). If my ideas here resonate but you aren\u2019t sure what to do next, I recommend looking at some of his work.     Easy to navigate     We spend much more time reading code than writing it.      Far     more time. It\u2019s a little disappointing how much we invest in our coding tools compared to our reading tools, but that\u2019s a topic for another rant\u2026     Often, you are reading your code because it is doing something wrong. This implies that you know what it ought to be doing, and so are reading with the intent to locate a specific part of the code. Once you locate that piece of code, you\u2019ll want to understand it (so you can fix it). Hopefully it is compact enough to fit in your short-term memory!     Designing for unit tests provides everything we\u2019re hoping for. If you have a long function that does multiple things, you can\u2019t write a unit test for it (since it represents multiple units), so you\u2019ll have to refactor it into a sequence or chain of functions.     Once refactored into separate, unit-sized functions      with names     , you\u2019ve now given yourself \u201cheadings\u201d for each piece of code. Headings are much easier to navigate than a single paragraph of text.     It\u2019s up to you, but if each function has a name that actually represents what it does, you\u2019ve given it a sensible heading. And if each function has a coherent, \u201cworks/doesn\u2019t work\u201d testable step of the overall functionality, the name will be obvious (if perhaps verbose), and the place(s) it is called from will be simple sequences of function calls.     When you need to find that functionality later, rather than it being in the middle of a run-on paragraph of code, it will be in a nice, bounded, labelled, unit-testable block.     And yes, this may lead to many functions that are only ever called once in your application. That\u2019s fine, because we\u2019re optimising for      reading     here, and the most efficient reading happens when you don\u2019t have to read a function at all.     Easy to modify     Once you\u2019ve found the piece of code, you likely want to modify it. This means understanding where it fits in the overall sequence, what other components produce its inputs, and which components depend on its outputs and side effects.     Assuming you have already broken up your monolithic functions into coherent chunks of functionality, the next step in making them testable is to be clear about the inputs and outputs.     We\u2019ll deal with side effects later, which means right now we are concerned with functions that      return values     or      mutate arguments     (or\u2026 ick\u2026 both). The former are easy to test directly, and the latter are perfect for       unittest.mock     Your goal when testing function inputs and outputs is to      exhaustively     prove that the      behaviour has not changed     . Or if you dislike the idea that your code will ever be changed, you\u2019re proving that the behaviour      matches the specification perpetually     (not just the first time you translated it into code).     Easily modifying code means being able to quickly detect when you\u2019ve accidentally altered the behaviour. So if it\u2019s tested exhaustively, it\u2019s easier to modify. But even if the tests are not exhaustive, the design implications are useful.     Functions that have complex interactions between arguments, unpredictable results, or too many arguments are not just difficult to tets. They\u2019re difficult to read, understand, use, and modify.     Imagine your function takes eight      True      False     flags. That\u2019s 256 combinations you need to test, not including genuine error cases. Depending on your patience, you might get through the first ten or twenty before deciding to refactor the function.     Or maybe your function\u2019s stated purpose is to update a parameter\u2019s attribute when it could have just returned the calculated result. You\u2019ve restricted your ability to reuse the function, or to modify the attribute. But the warning sign is that each test now includes setup and teardown, rather than a simple comparison.     If it\u2019s painful to write tests for your functions, it will be painful to modify them as well.     Easy to identify and avoid side effects     Side effects are simultaneously the biggest challenge in software development, and also the entire point of it. While once upon a time producing a single result was a worthwhile benefit of a computer (whether electronic, analog or human), today we rely on multiple asynchronous outputs from any computation, as well as ambient inputs from external data sources.     Tests dislike side effects. They      really     dislike side effects. Code with side effects implicitly has ordering constraints, timing constraints, complex setup and teardown processes, thread affinity, and may require additional or platform-specific hardware.     And unsurprisingly, humans also dislike side effects. When reading code, you have to keep an abstract state machine running inside your head to track what each variable currently holds so you can figure out what operations will actually do. Each external source of data (reading from a file, for example) resets your in-brain state to \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d. Each external action (opening file) is an operation that resets your in-brain sequence to \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d.     Side effects destroy our ability to reason about how code will be executed.     When you are architecting your code for testing, you\u2019re going to isolate side effects from computation steps. Are you trying to test a function that adds a list of numbers from a file? Consider a function that opens and reads the file, and a separate function that adds a list of numbers. Now you can test the addition function without needing a real file on a real file system.     Copying a set of files from one location to another? Collect all the metadata about those files in one function, calculate which ones need to be copied in the next, and then do the actual copying in the third function.     This      read      transform      apply     sequence clarifies which external state is used and where. It forces you to give each function useful names, and determine the structure of data passed between them.     You can now test the transformation on fake data, as exhaustively as you like, without any of the constraints imposed by side effects.     You can more easily find, understand, and fix the code based on the problem description, and debug issues by comparing function inputs and outputs against reality.     Transform logic is more portable, as all platform-specific code is in the reading or applying stages. Your unit test matrix shrinks, even as you test more functions, because each function has more focus. One edge case on one platform impacts one test, not your entire suite.     Most side effects look very much like reading or mutating external state. Updating a field on some global object? Sending a progress message? Checking a configuration option? Make them inputs to your functions - a callback function (      tell_user     ) is better than a global name (      print      even if the default argument is actually just the global     One day, you\u2019ll need to capture or suppress side effects for testing. The next, you\u2019ll want to find the code that causes a particular side effect. Later, you\u2019ll need to update your calling code to handle the side-effect differently. In all scenarios, you benefit from making them an explicit part of your interface.     Summary     While easily-measured metrics are a popular way to evaluate code complexity, they can never give you the full story.     Various languages claim to be control complexity through fixed code styles, flexible code styles, static typing, dynamic typing, nominal typing, structural typing, separate interface definitions, converged interface definitions, significant whitespace, insiginificant whitespace, and more ideas that are the exact opposite of someone else\u2019s idea.     Regardless of how much code you have or the style it\u2019s been written in, if it\u2019s easy to navigate, easy to modify, and easy to identify and avoid side effects, you\u2019ve likely got complexity under control.     And the easiest way to control complexity in Python is to write tests. Not because test coverage magically results in better code, but because architecting your code to be testable is the same as architecting for humans.

It waswritten up as a Django Enhancement Proposal (DEP), and numbered as      DEP 10     Changing the governance of the Django project is not something to dolightly, and not something that could be done lightly. It required theagreement of the Django core team, the Django Technical Board, and theBoard of Directors of the Django Software Foundation. All of thosegroups have now held their deliberations, and voted to accept DEP 10.     In the coming weeks, implementation of DEP 10 will start in earnest,but today it's worth giving a quick summary of what's changing andwhy. For the full details you can also read the DEP (though keep inmind it's a governance document that tries to be as precise aspossible and cover a lot of potential edge cases, and so is a bit      History and rationale      The Django open-source project was started by Adrian Holovaty andJacob Kaplan-Moss, who also served as the first leaders of theproject. They made the first few grants of commit access to otherpeople back in the early days after Django was open-sourced, and thecore team of committers had grown significantly by 2014, when Adrianand Jacob chose to step down from their leadership roles. At that timethe basic structure, of a core team of committers who could add codeto Django as they chose, was retained, and a new group -- a \"TechnicalBoard\" of five committers, elected by the core committers -- wascreated to serve as an ultimate tie-breaking decision-maker.      In practice, however, almost all code added to Django now is merged bythe Django Fellows -- paid contractors of the Django SoftwareFoundation, whose responsibilities include triaging, reviewing, andmerging pull requests to Django -- or by a small number of activevolunteer committers. And all releases of Django are now issued by theFellows, on schedules decided well in advance. Which means most of thehistorical \"core team\" of committers now have very little directinvolvement with Django despite holding significant theoretical powerwithin the project. And instead of committers discussing and decidingamongst themselves, nearly all technical decisions in Django'sdevelopment are made by consensus on public forums where anyone canparticipate.      Additionally, the growth of that \"core team\" has slowed almost to astandstill; new committers are added only very rarely, and there'sneither a clear path to \"core\" status nor any way for someone to tellwhether they are, or could be, a good candidate for it. Discussions onproject mailing lists and in-person at conferences have also indicatedthat many potential contributors measure themselves against anunrealistically low estimate of their own capabilities, and an unrealisticallyhigh estimate of the importance of the existing \"core\" developers, which hasthe effect of discouraging perfectly well-qualified people from attemptingto get more seriously involved in contributing to Django.      All of this is frustrating for everyone, and not good for Django'slong-term health as a project. Replacing or reforming \"Django core\"and the project's governance has thus become a perennial topic of longdiscussions, especially among the current \"core\" team and groups likethe DSF membership.      What's changing      As of the adoption of DEP 10, the structure of the Django open-sourceproject is changing in several ways. The former \"core team\" is nowdissolved, and the commit access of the former \"core\" members will becommit access, but only to merge pull requests from others: Mergerscannot decide to add things to Django on their own initiative, andhold no special decision-making privileges.      Alongside this, a new role of \"Releaser\" is being created, and willhave access to issue releases of Django and carry out the associatedmechanics (like bumping version numbers in key files).      Technical decisions are already, in practice, made by consensus inpublic venues where anyone can participate; this is now formalized asthe primary and expected way Django will be developed, and there willnot be any special class of \"committers\" or \"core\" individuals withspecial power to commit or block something solely on their own say-so.      The Technical Board will be kept as a final decision-making authorityfor cases where this is needed -- which have historically come up onlyrarely -- and is also charged with canvassing for ideas and proposalsfor Django's future technical direction, and with setting the release      However, membership on the Technical Board will no longer berestricted to committers, and the Technical Board will no longer beelected by committers, which is necessary because the \"core\"committers, as a group, cease to exist. Instead, anyone whodemonstrates a history of technical contributions to Django iseligible to run for the Technical Board, and the Technical Board willbe elected by the DSF's Individual members, all of whom have beengranted that membership based on their involvement with andcontributions to Django (and there are provisions for non-DSF-membervoters in the rare case where someone who's been involved with Djangodoes not hold DSF membership). This expands Technical Board electionsfrom having around 50 potential voters (with the old model of onlycommitters voting) to currently nearly 200, and quite likely more asthe DSF's membership grows.      Both the voter rolls, and the elections of the Technical Board, willbe overseen by the Board of Directors of the DSF (with any DSF Boardmember who runs for the Technical Board having to abstain frominvolvement in election oversight), which will have the authority toinvestigate the qualifications and good faith of both candidates and      Finally, the term \"Django Core Developer\" is being repurposed as anhonorary title, bestowed by the DSF on individuals who've had major,long-term impact on the history of Django, similar to the \"Fellow ofthe Python Software Foundation\" honor bestowed by the PSF forcontributions to Python. This title will be automatically granted toanyone who held \"core\" status -- in any of several forms, because thatterm has been nebulous on occasion -- at any time prior to DEP 10's      Effective immediately the Django Fellows, currently Carlton Gibson andMariusz Felisiak, are the initial Mergers and Releasers, and theDjango Technical Board will appoint additional people into those rolesas needed to keep them properly staffed. The current Technical Boardand the DSF Board also will work to hold the first election of a newTechnical Board under DEP 10, which will be held once the necessaryregistration and voting infrastructure are in place.      There will also be a flurry of updates to documentation and otherparts of the Django project website to ensure the new process andstructure are described as accurately as possible. Until then, pleaserefer people to this blog post for its summary of what's happening, orto the text of DEP 10 for the full details.      The future      Later this year we'll be celebrating the 15th anniversary of theoriginal open-sourcing of Django. In that time, there have been 278releases of the framework, nearly 1,900 people have contributed to theprimary repository, and the number of people who've learned and usedDjango is nearly impossible to measure; the main django-users mailinglist has tens of thousands of members, and is certain to representonly a fraction of the global Django-using community.      It's the hope of everyone who worked on this proposal that formallyopening up Django's governance and decision-making will put theproject on a healthier and more sustainable footing for the long term,and remove one of the barriers (the effective obsolescence of the\"Django core\" and stagnation of its membership) to welcoming newcontributors to Django from all parts of its worldwide community.

Here\u2019s the problem: people tend to log different things and call it a best-practice. And I am not sure why. When I start discussing this with other people I always end up repeating the exact same ideas over and over again.         So. Today I want to criticize the whole logging culture and provide a bunch of alternatives.          Logging does not make sense         Let\u2019s start with the most important one. Logging does not make any sense!         Let\u2019s review a popular code sample that you can find all across the internet:         So, what is going on here? Some complex computation fails and we log it. It seems like a good thing to do, doesn\u2019t it? Well. In this situation, I usually ask several important questions.          The first question is         : can we make bad states for         unreachable? If so, let\u2019s refactor our code to be type-safe. And eliminate all possible exceptions that can happen here with          mypy         . Sometimes this helps. And in this case, we would not have any exception handling and logging at all.          The second question I ask         : is it important that         did fail? There are a lot of cases when we don\u2019t care. Because of the retries, queues, or it might be an optional step that can be skipped. If this failure is not important - then just forget about it. But, if this failure is important - I want to know exactly everything: why and when did it fail. I want to know the whole stack trace, values of local variables, execution context, the total number of failures, and the number of affected users. I also want to be immediately notified of this important failure. And to be able to create a bug ticket from this failure in one click.         And yes, you got it correctly: it sounds like a job for Sentry, not logging.         I either want a quick notification about some critical error with everything inside, or I want nothing: a peaceful morning with tea and youtube videos. There\u2019s nothing in between for logging.          The third question is         : can we instead apply business monitoring to make sure our app works? We don\u2019t really care about exceptions and how to handle them. We care about the business value that we provide with our app. Sometimes your app does not raise any exception to be caught be Sentry. It can be broken in different ways. For example, your form validation can return errors when it should not normally happen. And you have zero exceptions, but a dysfunctional application. That\u2019s where business monitoring shines!         We can track different business metrics and make sure there are new orders, new comments, new users, etc. And if not - I want an emergency notification. I don\u2019t want to waste extra money on reading logging information after angry clients will call or text me. Please, don\u2019t treat your users as a monitoring service!          The last question is         : do you normally expect         to fail? Like HTTP calls or database access. If so,          don\u2019t use exceptions         , use           Result          monad         instead. This way you can clearly indicate that something is going to fail. And act with confidence. And do not log anything. Just let it fail.          Logging is a side effect         One more important monad-related topic is the pureness of the function that has a logger call inside. Let\u2019s compare two similar functions:         And:         The main difference between these two functions is that the first one is a perfect pure function and the second one is          IO         -bound impure one.         What consequences does it have?          We have to change our return type to           IOResult[float]          because logging is impure and can fail (yes, loggers can fail and break your app)          We need to test this side effect. And we need to remember to do so! Unless this side effect is explicit in the return type         Wise programmers even use special           Writer          monad         to make logging pure and explicit. And that requires to significantly change the whole architecture around this function.         We also might want to pass the correct          logger         instance, which probably implies that we have to use          dependency injection based on           RequiresContext         monad.         All I want to say with all these abstractions is that proper logging architecture is hard. It is not just about writing         here and there. It is a complex process of creating proper abstractions, composing them, and maintaining strict layers of pure and impure code.         Is your team ready for this?          Logging is a subsystem         We used to log things into a single file. It was fun!         Even this simple setup required us to do periodical log file rotation. But still, it was easy. We also used          grep         to find things in this file. But, even then we had problems. Do you happen to have several servers? Good luck finding any required information in all of these files and          ssh         connections.         But, now it is not enough! With all these microservices, cloud-native, and other 2020-ish tools we need complex subsystems to work with logging. It includes (but is not limited to):          ELK:           ElasticSearch + Logstash + Kibana           Graphana + Loki         And here\u2019s          an example         of what it takes to set this thing up with ELK stack:         Isn\u2019t it a bit too hard?! Look, I just want to write strings into          stdout         . And then store it somewhere.         But no. You need a database. And a separate web-service. You also have to monitor your logging subsystem. And periodically update it, you also have to make sure that it is secure. And has enough resources. And everyone has access to it. And so on and so forth.         Of course, there are cloud providers just for logging. It might be a good idea to consider using them.          Logging is hard to manage         In case you are still using logging after all my previous arguments, you will find out that it requires a lot of discipline and tooling. There are several well-known problems:           Logging should be very strict about its format. Do you remember that we are probably going to store our logs in a NoSQL database? Our logs need to be indexable. You would probably end up using             structlog           or a similar solution. In my opinion, this should be the default           The next thing to fight is levels. All developers will use their own ideas on what is critical and what\u2019s not. Unless you (as an architect) will write a            clear policy           that will cover most of the cases. You might also need to review it carefully. Otherwise, your logging database might blow up with useless data           Your logging usage should be consistent!All people tend to write in their own style. There\u2019s            a linter           for that! It will enforce:           Instead of:           And many other edge cases.           Logging should be business-oriented.I usually see people using logging with a minimal amount of useful information. For example, if you are logging an invalid current object state: it is not enough! You need to do more: you need to show how this object got into this invalid state. There are different approaches to this problem. Some use simple solutions like            version history           , some people use            EventSourcing           to compose their objects from changes. And some libraries log the entire execution context, logical steps that were taken, and changes made to the object. Like             dry-python/stories           (            docs on logging           ). And here\u2019s how the context looks like:  find_category  check_expiration  calculate_discount (errored: TypeError)  category_id = 1024                # Story argument           See? It contains the full representation of what\u2019s happened and how to recreate this error. Not just some random state information here and there. And you don\u2019t even have to call logger yourself. It will handled for you. By the way, it even has a            native Sentry integration           , which is better in my opinion.           You should pay attention to what you log.There are            GDPR rules on logging           and specialized security audits for your logs. Common sense dictates that logging passwords, credit cards, emails, etc is not secure. But, sadly, common sense is not enough. This is a complex process to follow.         There are other problems to manage as well. My point here is to show that you will need senior people to work on that: by creating policies, writing down processes, and setting up your logging toolchain.          What to do instead?         Let\u2019s do a quick recap:          Logging does not make much sense in monitoring and error tracking. Use better tools instead: like error and business monitorings with alerts          Logging adds significant complexity to your architecture. And it requires more testing. Use architecture patterns that will make logging an explicit part of your contracts          Logging is a whole infrastructure subsystem on its own. And quite a complex one. You will have to maintain it or to outsource this job to existing logging services          Logging should be done right. And it is hard. You will have to use a lot of tooling. And you will have to mentor developers that are unaware of the problems we have just discussed         Is logging worth it? You should make an informed decision based on this knowledge and your project requirements. In my opinion, it is not required for the most of the regular web apps.         Please, get this right. I understand that logging can be really useful (and sometimes even the only source of useful information). Like for on-premise software, for example. Or for initial steps when your app is not fully functioning yet. It would be hard to understand what is going on without logging. I am fighting an \u201coverlogging\u201d culture. When logs are used just for no good reason. Because developers just do it without analyzing costs and tradeoffs.         Are you joining my side?

Published:      March 16, 2020      Django      Python      This post now has       a followup     Recently I\u2019ve seen posts and questions pop up in a few places about      a sort of \u201centerprise\u201d Django style guide     that\u2019s been getting attention. There are a number of things I disagree with in that guide, but the big one, and the one people have mostly been asking about, is the recommendation to add a \u201cservice layer\u201d to Django applications. The short version of my opinion on this is: it\u2019s probably not what you want in Django\u00a0apps.     The longer version follows\u00a0below.     What is a service layer,\u00a0anyway?     First it\u2019s helpful to understand what\u2019s meant by \u201cservice\u201d and what the theoretical goal is, so let\u2019s take an example. Suppose you have a Django-powered blog app, with an      Entry     model representing entries in the blog. The standard way to query for entries would be something\u00a0like:     This would get you a      QuerySet     of all\u00a0entries.     The \u201cservice\u201d approach would be to do something\u00a0like:     Where the      service     module implements a variety of functions/methods that, under the hood, call various Django       ORM     methods to actually perform queries and manipulate model objects. Typical \u201cservice\u201d implementations provide at least things like     (or other synonyms for those operations), and often also provide more complex \u201cbusiness logic\u201d methods. In a simple case, things like \u201cpublishing\u201d a blog entry by changing its status from draft to live. More complex data models and logic will end up with more complex service\u00a0layers.     Quick aside: the earliest Django       ORM     was actually a code generator that would leave behind one auto-generated module per model class, very similar to the type of      service     module mentioned here, containing all the query methods for working with that model. For the first public release it was still there, but switched to generating the modules in-memory rather than leaving them on the filesystem. This was confusing and nearly universally frowned upon; if you want an overview of why, skim to the second section of      this old post     , and if you want to know how something like that even gets implemented, I walk through a simplified example      in this other old post     . Anyway, Django 0.95 (released in July 2006) replaced the code generator with the initial implementation of the modern Django       ORM     Meanwhile, the motivations for the service-layer approach mostly come down to two\u00a0things:      Provide a clear place to put \u201cbusiness logic\u201d \u2014 common queries and operations that will need to be performed repeatedly on or with instances of the data\u00a0models.      Hide the underlying implementation from all other code, so that you could swap it out and replace with something else and not have to rewrite any code other than the\u00a0\u201cservice\u201d.     General problems with \u201cservice\u201d\u00a0approaches     I have several general objections to this approach that apply beyond just the use case of\u00a0Django.     One is that this is taking a pretty common principle of \u201centerprise\u201d architecture and applying it without careful consideration. The general idea is to try to put layers of indirection/abstraction in front of various components, so that the actual implementations of those components can be changed without breaking other\u00a0code.     There certainly are times and places when this is a useful thing to do, but there are also times and places when it isn\u2019t useful. A typical web application does involve a lot of components, and it is the case that any application that gets large enough or lasts long enough will eventually want to change/swap some of them. But effort should be focused on the ones that are likely to      actually     get changed/swapped, rather than on some sort of reflex action of always putting layers of indirection in front of everything without pausing to think about whether it\u2019s really useful (see also:       YAGNI     Since I\u2019m going to talk specifically about Django in the next section I\u2019ll use it as an example here: a lot of parts of Django are swappable out of the box in ways that are meant to minimize code changes. Caching layers, session storage, authentication sources, file-storage implementations, logging systems, email-sending, templating languages\u2026 the list of things you can easily swap, because they\u2019ve been put behind configuration and generic/indirect APIs, is pretty long. But it\u2019s also a list that\u2019s informed by experience and actual practice. Or, in other words, it\u2019s a list of things that commonly      do     get changed/swapped over the life of a lot of real projects. Other components, like the forms library, the admin interface, and so on are effectively optional, and often will be dropped for something else, or just not even used in the first\u00a0place.     But what about the data modeling and access component (which in Django\u2019s case is its       ORM     )? In theory, hiding it behind a service layer means you can change it out for something else without rewriting other code. But how often does that really happen in practice? My experience \u2014 and I\u2019ve been working in this industry for over 15 years at places both big and small, and been through some pretty major platform migrations \u2014 is that it happens almost never. Swapping something as major as how you model and persist/retrieve your core data is not something you do lightly, and typically only happens at a time when you\u2019re making other massive changes \u2014 completely switching platform/language/framework, or otherwise doing a ground-up rewrite of the entire system. And, ironically, it\u2019s in the kinds of organizations      most     likely to insist on \u201centerprise\u201d architecture patterns that the payoff is      least     likely ever to be realized, because such organizations are almost fanatically averse to the kind of change this architecture is meant to enable. See, for example, all the places for which we know a decade (or longer) is not even close to enough time to do platform\u00a0upgrades.     A second problem is that when you decide to go the \u201cservice\u201d route, you are changing the nature of your business. This is related to an argument I bring up occasionally when people tell me they don\u2019t use \u201cframeworks\u201d and never will: what they actually mean, whether they realize it or not, is \u201cwe built and now have to maintain and train our developers on our own ad-hoc private framework, on top of whatever our normal business is\u201d. And adopting the service approach essentially means that, whatever your business was previously, now your business is that plus developing and maintaining something close to your own private       ORM     This is a necessary consequence, because sooner or later you\u2019re going to need a significant fraction of the features of whatever your      real     data layer is, which means you will have to implement sufficient features in your service layer to be able to take advantage of them. And I\u2019d bet a lot of money that most places which do this do      not     take the necessary level of care to ensure their reimplementation of those features is truly generic enough to still allow swapping out the underlying implementation. Designing good and thoughtful APIs for interacting with your data is difficult and time-consuming. What\u2019s much easier, and can be done quickly to clear out your cards for the current sprint, is copying someone else\u2019s already-designed     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     , which means the service layer, over time, almost always ends up with an     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     that\u2019s tightly coupled to whatever the underlying data layer\u2019s     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     is, and there goes a lot of the claimed benefit of the service layer out the\u00a0window.     Yet another issue is that this is a solved problem, and the solution is not service layers. If you want a clear separation of \u201cbusiness logic\u201d and \u201cdata access\u201d, and/or believe you need the benefits that you think will come from decoupling them, the solution is      the Data Mapper        ORM      pattern     . Writing a \u201cservice\u201d to hide your real data-access layer is basically just Data Mapper with extra steps and without being able to take advantage of off-the-shelf implementations. And while you will have a theoretically harder time swapping it out for some other underlying component, I\u2019ve already mentioned the problem with trying to optimize for\u00a0that.     Now, about\u00a0Django\u2026     Some of the general objections above apply even more strongly to the specific case of Django. For example: in general, people don\u2019t often swap out their data access layer without also doing other massive rewrites. And in Django-based applications it\u2019s even less likely to try to swap out the       ORM     without other huge code changes happening at the same time, because the Django       ORM     is probably the single most tightly-integrated component of the entire framework \u2014 if you stop using it, you\u2019re throwing away so much other stuff that \u201cwhy are we even still using Django\u201d becomes a really significant\u00a0question.     And I said above that I think the real solution, if you feel like you need the decoupling of \u201cbusiness logic\u201d and data access/modeling, is a Data Mapper       ORM     . Well, Django\u2019s       ORM     is not that; it\u2019s very much an      Active Record       ORM     , and trying to use it in a Data Mapper style is going to result in a lot of unhappiness. You never really want to be fighting against your framework that\u00a0way.     Worse still is the issue of \u201cservice\u201d layers requiring you to basically build your own       ORM     . To really do a backend-agnostic service layer on top of the Django       ORM     , you need to replace or abstract away some of its most fundamental and convenient abstractions. For example, most of the commonly-used       ORM     query methods return either instances of your model classes, or instances of Django\u2019s      QuerySet     class (which is a kind of chained-     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     results wrapper around a query). In order to avoid tightly coupling to the structure and     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     of those Django-specific objects, your service layer needs to translate them into something else \u2014 likely generic iterables to replace      QuerySet     , and some type of \u201cbusiness object\u201d instance to replace model-class instances. Which is a non-trivial amount of work even in patterns like Data Mapper that are designed for this, and even more difficult  to do in an Active Record       ORM     that\u00a0isn\u2019t.     And in the process of abstracting away those underlying       ORM     objects and interfaces, you also are throwing away a lot of their utility.      QuerySet     is already a really cool (no bias on my part here, of course) caching query wrapper with a bunch of functionality to turn common use patterns into efficient query behavior. When you abstract away its existence, you either lose that or have to reimplement it\u00a0yourself.     You\u2019ll also lose, or have to abstract/reimplement, a lot of the integrations between the       ORM     and other parts of Django \u2014 no more handy generic views, no more helpful auto-generating forms or (if you\u2019re using      DRF     ) serializers, and so on, because those all break the \u201cservice\u201d abstraction by exposing other code to the existence and APIs of the underlying       ORM     What to do\u00a0instead     I\u2019ve said a few times in passing, and covered in more detail in the \u201cMastering the Django       ORM     \u201d tutorial I\u2019ve presented a few times at conferences, that (in my opinion) in most well-designed Django applications, the models \u2014 and potentially associated utility code, like custom      Manager     or      QuerySet     subclasses \u2014      are     the     <abbr title=\"Application Programming Interface\">       API     exposed to other code. Which in turn means that they are the place where the \u201cbusiness logic\u201d should be\u00a0implemented.     The       ORM     itself already provides the common query patterns you\u2019d implement in a \u201cservice\u201d layer, so you don\u2019t need to reimplement them. When going beyond those, here\u2019s a quick set of recommendations for how to implement\u00a0things:      If you need an alternate constructor for model instances, do it as a manager method (not as a       classmethod      on the model, or in some other class or code elsewhere). In my        ORM      tutorial I use the example of a model that stores an       RGB      color as three integer fields, and implementing a manager method that can build an instance from a hexadecimal value, like      If you have a custom, complex and/or often-used query against the model\u2019s entire table, do it as either a manager method (if you think you\u2019ll never need to use it chained after other query methods), or as a       QuerySet      method (if you will need to be able to chain it after other things). And remember you can write a       QuerySet      subclass with your custom method(s) and then       auto-generate a model manager from it      If you need more complex fetching of related objects from a single model instance, do it as a method on that model\u00a0class.      Any sort of logical operation on only a single model instance should be a method on the model\u00a0class.      Any sort of logical operation on a set of instances of the same model should be a method on the model\u2019s manager or its       QuerySet     If this sounds complex, it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve written out a bunch of specific examples \u2014 the base pattern is \u201cthings that involve one model instance go on the model class; things involving multiple or all instances go on the model\u2019s      QuerySet     or\u00a0manager\u201d.     And in general, other code should obey the      Law of Demeter     with respect to an application\u2019s models. The traditional \u201cone-dot rule\u201d version is a bit inflexible for a language like Python (where lookups often start with      self     ), and for the specific model/manager/query method architecture used in the Django       ORM     , so if you want an exhaustive version of it, code external to a Django model class should restrict itself to\u00a0accessing:      On an instance of the model, any custom public methods, and      . Access to fields (including relationship traversals) for reading should be discouraged, and for writing should be forbidden. Access to      and      should similarly be\u00a0off-limits.      From an instance of a related model, the same as above (essentially allowing a \u201ctwo-dot\u201d access for some\u00a0cases).      On the model class itself, the default constructor, the manager, its top-level object-creation methods (      ) and any alternate constructors or custom top-level query methods, but generally       not      built-in query methods other than      (again, allowing limited \u201ctwo-dot\u201d accesses). The one exception here is for using generic views that need access to a broader range of the query methods (like      ) to do their work; views that are specific to a single model class should be making use of purpose-built query methods on that model\u2019s manager or       QuerySet      instead of embedding their own complex query logic, or retrieving a single instance and then invoking public methods on it that implement the desired logical\u00a0operations.     This usually means views should contain as little \u201cbusiness logic\u201d as possible, instead deferring to the model for that. In the tutorial I give the example of a bug-tracking system where a view that resolves a ticket is implemented by querying for the      Ticket     instance, then manually setting a bunch of its fields and calling     \u2014 then contrast it with an implementation where     is implemented as a method on      Ticket     , so all the view has to do is query up the instance and then call its     method. The second version is almost always going to be the right way to do things (and not just in Django). As the old joke goes, when you want to walk the dog, you shouldn\u2019t reach down and grab and pick up and put down each of its legs manually in order; you should just trust that the dog knows how to     on its own. This is especially true with Active Record ORMs like\u00a0Django\u2019s.     Speaking of which: following the Law of Demeter is a lot harder, and often just plain impossible, in a \u201cservice\u201d approach, because the service layer takes responsibility for implementing \u201cbusiness logic\u201d operations like resolving the      Ticket     or walking the      Dog     , and so has to have detailed knowledge of the structure of those objects and how to reach into them and manipulate their fields (if it didn\u2019t, and those objects instead exposed their own logical     , etc. operations as methods, there\u2019d be no point to the service layer, because the \u201cbusiness logic\u201d would already be implemented\u00a0elsewhere!).     Go forth, and write service layers no\u00a0more     I\u2019ve mentioned a couple times above that I\u2019m presenting my opinions, and usually at the end of a post like this I make a point of reiterating that and saying that if something else works for you, do the thing that works for you. And it\u2019s still true that what I\u2019ve said above is just my opinion, and you shouldn\u2019t necessarily take it as a set of ironclad rules you have to\u00a0follow.     But in this case I\u2019m going to modify my usual statement slightly: the above are not just my random personal preferences. They are opinions, but they\u2019re informed opinions from a      lot     of time spent working on and around large codebases (many in Django, some not), and from seeing what worked and what didn\u2019t. My experience is that attempts to build service layers usually fall into the \u201cdidn\u2019t work\u201d category, and that sticking mostly to the guidelines I\u2019ve laid out above for how to work with models and \u201cbusiness logic\u201d in Django is more likely to wind up in the \u201cworked\u201d\u00a0category.     And if, after reading this, you still are convinced that a service-layer approach with business logic separate from the data models is the right thing for you, then go for it, but I\u2019ll urge you one last time to at least strongly consider      not     doing it with Django, and instead building on top of a component stack that uses a Data Mapper       ORM     (in the Python world,      SQLAlchemy     is far and away the best choice) that natively incorporates that type of separation. In the long term, I think that\u2019s going to be a much happier and more productive path than trying to fit the square peg of a service layer into the round hole of Django\u2019s Active Record\u00a0approach.

At least, that's the impression we get from many developers: \"writing docs is boring\"; \"it's a chore, nobody likes to do it\". I have come to realize I'm one of those rare people who likes to write both code and documentation.        Nobody will argue against documentation. It is clear that for an open-source software project, documentation is the public face of the project. The docs influence how people interact with the software and with the community. It sets the tone about inclusiveness, how people communicate and what users and contributors can do. Looking at the results of a \u201cNumPy Tutorial\u201d search on any search engine also gives an idea of the demand for this kind of content - it is possible to find documentation about how to read the NumPy documentation!        I've started working at Quansight in January, and I have started doing work related to the         NumPy CZI Grant        . As a former professor in mathematics, this seemed like an interesting project both because of its potential impact on the NumPy (and larger) community and because of its relevance to me, as I love writing educational material and documentation. Having official high-level documentation written using up-to-date content and techniques will certainly mean more users (and developers/contributors) are involved in the NumPy community.        So, if everybody agrees on its importance, why is it so hard to write good documentation?        Why do we lack documentation?        In a recent article about documentation for open source data analytics libraries,         Geiger et al.        point out that \"In a         2017 GitHub survey        of OSS contributors, 93% reported that         incomplete or outdated documentation is a pervasive problem        but         60% of contributors say they rarely or never contribute to documentation        (Zlotnick et al. 2017).\" At the same time, still in the words of Geiger et al., \"Many interviewees who regularly contribute documentation to such projects stated that they did not feel like they received same levels of positive community feedback for documentation work as they did for adding new features or fixing bugs.\" The authors in this paper go as far as saying that documentation is the         invisible work        behind these projects.        It doesn't help that many of these projects have been around for some time and have developed in decentralized, community-based ways. This is both positive and negative since it leaves the choice of the type of contribution to the new contributor. Most of the time, people who arrive want to make a big impact, and they perceive implementing a new feature or solving a pending bug, not writing documentation, as the way to do that.        Coming from an academic background, the same kind of dynamics seems to apply. Writing a paper or doing an experiment is far more appealing than writing a textbook or developing high-quality educational materials. But educational materials can have a huge impact and effectively bring people into the community. For me, realizing this was a turning point on the way I looked at documentation.        Who writes the docs?        If we look at proprietary or company-backed software projects, often professional technical writers are working on the docs. Having access to these professionals to do the documentation can make a huge difference. However, even then there can be problems. In her excellent talk         \"Who Writes the Docs?\"        , Beth Aitman says         People who work on docs often don't feel like their work is valued (...) Being in a position where your value is questioned is pretty horrible.        As I got more involved in the open source world, I realized that the people writing docs were not only invisible but were sometimes actively discouraged. There is even a differentiation in naming such contributions; have you ever heard of a \"core docs developer\"?         Rich Bowen says         There's common wisdom in the open source world: Everybody knows that the documentation is awful, that nobody wants to write it, and that this is just the way things are. But the truth is that there are lots of people who want to write the docs. We just make it too hard for them to participate. So they write articles on Stack Overflow, on their blogs, and third-party forums. Although this can be good, it's also a great way for worst-practice solutions to bloom and gain momentum. Embracing these people and making them part of the official documentation effort for your project has many advantages.        Even when the community is welcoming, documentation is often seen as a \"good first issue\", meaning that the docs end up being written by the least experienced contributors in the community. This can have its advantages, as it may give voice to the users who are experiencing difficulties, improving the communication between the projects and its community. However, it may transfer the responsibility of one of the most crucial aspects of any project to novice users, who have neither the knowledge or the experience to make decisions about it.        What can we do about it?        So if expert users and developers are too busy to write docs, or just don't want to, how can we address this problem?        As much as the culture is changing, and many people are talking about the importance of documentation, we still have         technical debt        related to projects that have been around for a while. This is not something we can overlook: having good documentation is the difference between being successful or not in solving our users' (and clients') problems. Furthermore, it is also crucial if we aim to improve reproducibility and transparency issues in science and data analytics.        In this sense, grants like the one NumPy just received are extremely important to create momentum around documentation and reshape the community into one that values those contributions.        Short and long-term goals        As part of our work related to the CZI grant, we have submitted a         NumPy Enhancement Proposal (NEP)        that proposes a restructure the NumPy documentation, to make it more organized and discoverable for beginners and experienced users.        In practical terms, we propose reorganizing the docs into the four categories mentioned in Daniele Procida's article         \"What nobody tells you about documentation\"        , namely Tutorials, How-Tos, Reference Guide and Explanations. We believe that this will have several consequences:         Improving on the quality and discoverability of the documentation as a whole;         Showing a clearer difference between documentation aimed at different users (novices vs. experts, for example)         Giving users more opportunities to contribute, generating content that can be shared directly on NumPy's official documentation         Building a documentation team as a first-class team in the project, which helps create an explicit role as          documentation creator         . This helps people better identify how they can contribute beyond code.         Diversifying our contributor base, allowing people from different levels of expertise and different life experiences to contribute. This is also extremely important so that we have a better understanding of our community and can be accessible, unbiased and welcoming to all people.        In the long term, having a process set up that can onboard new contributors and make sure they have the tools and environment they need to contribute can significantly improve the quality of our projects and broaden our contributors/maintainers base.        Conclusion        Documentation is much more than a complement to code. It is education, it is community building, and it is how we can make sure the project is healthy and sustainable.

World Wandering Dudes          is a simulation framework in which you initiate a \u201cworld\u201d which consists of a \u201cfield\u201d and a set of \u201ccreatures\u201d (dudes). The field has food on it. Each day, the creatures run around gathering the food which they need to survive and\u00a0reproduce.          Example          Here\u2019s an example of a few days passing in a world where food randomly sprouts each day, never spoiling, initiated with a single creature (particular note: after day 1 passes and there are two creatures, one of them doesn\u2019t store enough food to reproduce at the end of the day):          Taking a snapshot of the world at the end of each day for the first 20 or so days you can see the creatures take over the full field before coming to some general equilibrium state.          How the world\u00a0works          A. Each day consists of a number of discrete time steps.  During each time step, the creatures move around the field randomly, if they find food they grab it from the field and store\u00a0it.          B. At the end of the day, a few things\u00a0happen:            Each creature must eat some food.  If they don\u2019t have enough stored, they\u00a0die.            If they have enough food after eating, they may also reproduce.  Offspring may have mutated properties (e.g., they may move a little faster each time step - speedy creatures - or they may eat less food - efficient\u00a0creatures)            The food may spoil throughout the world (or not) and new food may sprout on the\u00a0field.          Examining the historical\u00a0record          You can also look at this historical recordfor the field and examine some metrics including total creature count, birth/death rate, the mutation composition of the creatures, amount of stored food, amount of ungathered food, and more:          Some phenomenological notes on this particular case (more details on the math behind some of this in future\u00a0posts):           The dynamics of the world are stochastic. For example, sometimes the first creature doesn\u2019t find any food and dies\u00a0immediately.           The population initially grows roughly exponentially as food becomes plentiful across the\u00a0map.           With the accumulated food on the field from the initial low-population days, the creatures grow in numbers beyond a sustainable population and a period of starvation and population culling follows.\u00a0:(           The population reaches an equilibrium at which the number of creatures is nearly the same as the amount of food sprouted each day (it\u2019s not exactly\u00a0equal!).           At equilibrium, the rate at which creatures are being born is equal to the rate at which they die (on average) and both appear to be about a third of the total population (it\u2019s not a\u00a0third!).           As mentioned above, upon reproduction the creatures will mutate and the fitter creatures may take over the world. In this particular case, efficient creatures come about first and quickly take over the population. The world can actually sustain a higher population of efficient vs normal/speedy creatures, so the total population increases accordingly. Shortly thereafter, a few speedy creatures start to show up and they, slowly, take over the world, out-competing the efficient creatures and slowly suppressing the overall\u00a0population.

It often comes up in programming contests and        technical interviews       . Implementing binary search turns out to be a challenging task, even when you understand the concept. Unless you\u2019re curious or have a specific assignment, you should always leverage existing libraries to do a binary search in Python or any other language.        In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to:        Use the          bisect        module to do a binary search in Python        Implement a binary search in Python both         recursively        and         iteratively        Recognize and fix         defects        in a binary search Python implementation        Analyze the         time-space complexity        of the binary search algorithm        Search even         faster        than binary search       This tutorial assumes you\u2019re a student or an         intermediate programmer       with an interest in algorithms and data structures. At the very least, you should be familiar with Python\u2019s built-in data types, such as        lists and tuples       . In addition, some familiarity with        recursion        classes        data classes       , and        lambdas       will help you better understand the concepts you\u2019ll see in this tutorial.       Below you\u2019ll find a link to the sample code you\u2019ll see throughout this tutorial, which requires Python 3.7 or later to run:         Get Sample Code:         Click here to get the sample code you'll use        to learn about binary search in Python in this tutorial.        Remove ads       Benchmarking       In the next section of this tutorial, you\u2019ll be using a subset of the        Internet Movie Database (IMDb)       to benchmark the performance of a few search algorithms. This dataset is free of charge for personal and non-commercial use. It\u2019s distributed as a bunch of compressed        tab-separated values (TSV)       files, which get daily updates.       To make your life easier, you can use a Python script included in the sample code. It\u2019ll automatically fetch the relevant file from IMDb, decompress it, and extract the interesting pieces:       Be warned that this will download and extract approximately 600 MB of data, as well as produce two additional files, which are about half of that in size. The download, as well as the processing of this data, might take a minute or two to complete.       Download IMDb       To manually obtain the data, navigate your web browser to       and grab the file called       , which contains the records of actors, directors, writers, and so on. When you decompress the file, you\u2019ll see the following content:nm0000001  Fred Astaire     1899       1987       (...)nm0000002  Lauren Bacall    1924       2014       (...)nm0000004  John Belushi     1949       1982       (...)       It has a        header       with the column names in the first line, followed by        data records       in each of the subsequent lines. Each record contains a unique identifier, a full name, birth year, and a few other attributes. These are all delimited with a tab character.       There are millions of records, so don\u2019t try to open the file with a regular text editor to avoid crashing your computer. Even specialized software such as spreadsheets can have problems opening it. Instead, you might take advantage of the high-performance data grid viewer included in        JupyterLab       , for example.       Read Tab-Separated Values       There are a few ways to parse a TSV file. For example, you can read it with        Pandas       , use a dedicated application, or leverage a few command-line tools. However, it\u2019s recommended that you use the hassle-free Python script included in the sample code.         Note:        As a rule of thumb, you should avoid parsing files manually because you might overlook         edge cases        . For example, in one of the fields, the delimiting tab character could be used literally inside quotation marks, which would break the number of columns. Whenever possible, try to find a relevant module in the standard library or a trustworthy third-party one.       Ultimately, you want to end up with two text files at your disposal:         names.txt         sorted_names.txt       One will contain a        list       of names obtained by cutting out the second column from the original TSV file:Lauren BacallBrigitte BardotJohn BelushiIngmar Bergman       The second one will be the sorted version of this.       Once both files are ready, you can load them into Python using this function:       This code returns a list of names pulled from the given file. Note that calling       on the resulting        string       removes the trailing newline character from each line. As an alternative, you could call       , but that would keep the unwanted newlines.        Remove ads       Measure the Execution Time       To evaluate the performance of a particular algorithm, you can measure its execution time against the IMDb dataset. This is usually done with the help of the built-in         time       or         timeit       modules, which are useful for timing a block of code.       You could also define a custom        decorator       to time a function if you wanted to. The sample code provided uses       , introduced in Python 3.7, because it offers high precision in nanoseconds.       Understanding Search Algorithms       Searching is ubiquitous and lies at the heart of computer science. You probably did several web searches today alone, but have you ever wondered what        searching       really means?       Search algorithms take many different forms. For example, you can:        Do a         full-text search        Match strings with         fuzzy searching        Find the shortest path in a graph        Query a database        Look for a minimum or maximum value       In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn about searching for an element in a sorted list of items, like a phone book. When you search for such an element, you might be asking one of the following questions:           Question           Answer           Is it there?           Yes           Where is it?           On the 42nd page           Which one is it?           A person named John Doe       The answer to the first question tells you whether an element is        present       in the collection. It always holds either        true       or        false       . The second answer is the        location       of an element within the collection, which may be unavailable if that element was missing. Finally, the third answer is the        element       itself, or a lack of it.         Note:        Sometimes there might be more than one correct answer due to         duplicate or similar items        . For example, if you have a few contacts with the same name, then they will all fit your search criteria. At other times, there might only be an approximate answer or no answer at all.       In the most common case, you\u2019ll be        searching by value       , which compares elements in the collection against the exact one you provide as a reference. In other words, your search criteria are the entire element, such as a number, a string, or an object like a person. Even the tiniest difference between the two compared elements won\u2019t result in a match.       On the other hand, you can be more granular with your search criteria by choosing some property of an element, such as a person\u2019s last name. This is called        searching by key       because you pick one or more attributes to compare. Before you dive into binary search in Python, let\u2019s take a quick look at other search algorithms to get a bigger picture and understand how they work.       Random Search       How might you look for something in your backpack? You might just dig your hand into it, pick an item at random, and see if it\u2019s the one you wanted. If you\u2019re out of luck, then you put the item back, rinse, and repeat. This example is a good way to understand        random search       , which is one of the least efficient search algorithms. The inefficiency of this approach stems from the fact that you\u2019re running the risk of picking the same wrong thing multiple times.         Note:        Funnily enough, this strategy         could        be the most efficient one, in theory, if you were         very        lucky or had a small number of elements in the collection.       The fundamental principle of this algorithm can be expressed with the following snippet of Python code:       The function loops until some element chosen at        random       matches the value given as input. However, this isn\u2019t very useful because the function returns either        None       implicitly or the same value it already received in a parameter. You can find the full implementation in the sample code available for download at the link below:         Get Sample Code:         Click here to get the sample code you'll use        to learn about binary search in Python in this tutorial.       For microscopic datasets, the random search algorithm appears to be doing its job reasonably fast:       However, imagine having to search like that through        millions       of elements! Here\u2019s a quick rundown of a performance test that was done against the IMDb dataset:           Search Term           Element Index           Best Time           Average Time           Worst Time            Fred Astaire            0            0.74s            21.69s            43.16s            Alicia Monica            4,500,000            1.02s            26.17s            66.34s            Baoyin Liu            9,500,000            0.11s            17.41s            51.03s            missing            N/A            5m 16s            5m 40s            5m 54s       Unique elements at different memory locations were specifically chosen to avoid bias. Each term was searched for ten times to account for the randomness of the algorithm and other factors such as garbage collection or system processes running in the background.         Note:        If you\u2019d like to conduct this experiment yourself, then refer back to the instructions in the introduction to this tutorial. To measure the performance of your code, you can use the built-in          time         and          timeit        modules, or you can time functions with a custom         decorator       The algorithm has a        non-deterministic performance       . While the average time to find an element doesn\u2019t depend on its whereabouts, the best and worst times are two to three orders of magnitude apart. It also suffers from inconsistent behavior. Consider having a collection of elements containing some duplicates. Because the algorithm picks elements at random, it\u2019ll inevitably return different copies upon subsequent runs.       How can you improve on this? One way to address both issues at once is by using a        linear search        Remove ads       Linear Search       When you\u2019re deciding what to have for lunch, you may be looking around the menu chaotically until something catches your eye. Alternatively, you can take a more systematic approach by scanning the menu from top to bottom and scrutinizing every item in a        sequence       . That\u2019s linear search in a nutshell. To implement it in Python, you could       elements to keep track of the current element\u2019s index:       The function loops over a collection of elements in a predefined and consistent order. It stops when the element is found, or when there are no more elements to check. This strategy guarantees that no element is visited more than once because you\u2019re traversing them in order by        index       Let\u2019s see how well linear search copes with the IMDb dataset you used before:           Search Term           Element Index           Best Time           Average Time           Worst Time            Fred Astaire            0            491ns            1.17\u00b5s            6.1\u00b5s            Alicia Monica            4,500,000            0.37s            0.38s            0.39s            Baoyin Liu            9,500,000            0.77s            0.79s            0.82s            missing            N/A            0.79s            0.81s            0.83s       There\u2019s hardly any variance in the lookup time of an individual element. The average time is virtually the same as the best and the worst one. Since the elements are always browsed in the same order, the number of comparisons required to find the same element doesn\u2019t change.       However, the lookup time grows with the increasing index of an element in the collection. The further the element is from the beginning of the list, the more comparisons have to run. In the worst case, when an element is missing, the whole collection has to be checked to give a definite answer.       When you project experimental data onto a plot and connect the dots, then you\u2019ll immediately see the relationship between element location and the time it takes to find it:       All samples lie on a straight line and can be described by a        linear function       , which is where the name of the algorithm comes from. You can assume that, on average, the time required to find any element using a linear search will be proportional to the number of all elements in the collection. They don\u2019t scale well as the amount of data to search increases.       For example, biometric scanners available at some airports wouldn\u2019t recognize passengers in a matter of seconds, had they been implemented using linear search. On the other hand, the linear search algorithm may be a good choice for smaller datasets, because it doesn\u2019t require        preprocessing       the data. In such a case, the benefits of preprocessing wouldn\u2019t pay back its cost.       Python already ships with linear search, so there\u2019s no point in writing it yourself. The        list       data structure, for example, exposes a method that will return the index of an element or raise an exception otherwise:       This can also tell you if the element is present in the collection, but a more        Pythonic       way would involve using the versatile        in       operator:       It\u2019s worth noting that despite using linear search under the hood, these built-in functions and operators will blow your implementation out of the water. That\u2019s because they were written in pure        C       , which compiles to native machine code. The standard Python interpreter is no match for it, no matter how hard you try.       A quick test with the        timeit       module reveals that the Python implementation might run almost ten times slower than the equivalent native one:       However, for sufficiently large datasets, even the native code will hit its limits, and the only solution will be to rethink the algorithm.         Note:        The         in        operator doesn\u2019t always do a linear search. When you use it on a         set        , for example, it does a hash-based search instead. The operator can work with any         iterable        , including         tuple         list         set         dict        , and         str        . You can even support your custom classes with it by implementing the         magic method        to define the underlying logic.       In real-life scenarios, the linear search algorithm should usually be avoided. For example, there was a time I wasn\u2019t able to register my cat at the vet clinic because their system kept crashing. The doctor told me he must eventually upgrade his computer because adding more records into the database makes it run slower and slower.       I remember thinking to myself at that point that the person who wrote that software clearly didn\u2019t know about the        binary search       algorithm!        Remove ads       Binary Search       The word        binary       is generally associated with the number 2. In this context, it refers to dividing a collection of elements into two halves and throwing away one of them at each step of the algorithm. This can dramatically reduce the number of comparisons required to find an element. But there\u2019s a catch\u2014elements in the collection must be         sorted       first.       The idea behind it resembles the steps for finding a page in a book. At first, you typically open the book to a completely random page or at least one that\u2019s close to where you think your desired page might be.       Occasionally, you\u2019ll be fortunate enough to find that page on the first try. However, if the page number is too low, then you know the page must be to the right. If you overshoot on the next try, and the current page number is higher than the page you\u2019re looking for, then you know for sure that it must be somewhere in between.       You repeat the process, but rather than choosing a page at random, you check the page located right in the        middle       of that new range. This minimizes the number of tries. A similar approach can be used in the        number guessing game       . If you haven\u2019t heard of that game, then you can look it up on the Internet to get a plethora of examples implemented in Python.         Note:        Sometimes, if the values are uniformly distributed, you can calculate the middle index with         linear interpolation        rather than taking the average. This variation of the algorithm will require even fewer steps.       The page numbers that restrict the range of pages to search through are known as the        lower bound       and the        upper bound       . In binary search, you commonly start with the first page as the lower bound and the last page as the upper bound. You must update both bounds as you go. For example, if the page you turn to is lower than the one you\u2019re looking for, then that\u2019s your new lower bound.       Let\u2019s say you were looking for a strawberry in a collection of fruits sorted in ascending order by size:       On the first attempt, the element in the middle happens to be a lemon. Since it\u2019s bigger than a strawberry, you can discard all elements to the right, including the lemon. You\u2019ll move the upper bound to a new position and update the middle index:       Now, you\u2019re left with only half of the fruits you began with. The current middle element is indeed the strawberry you were looking for, which concludes the search. If it wasn\u2019t, then you\u2019d just update the bounds accordingly and continue until they pass each other. For example, looking for a missing plum, which would go between the strawberry and a kiwi, will end with the following result:       Notice there weren\u2019t that many comparisons that had to be made in order to find the desired element. That\u2019s the magic of binary search. Even if you\u2019re dealing with a million elements, you\u2019d only require at most a handful of checks. This number won\u2019t exceed the        logarithm       base two of the total number of elements due to halving. In other words, the number of remaining elements is reduced by half at each step.       This is possible because the elements are already sorted by size. However, if you wanted to find fruits by another key, such as a color, then you\u2019d have to sort the entire collection once again. To avoid the costly overhead of sorting, you might try to compute different views of the same collection in advance. This is somewhat similar to creating a        database index       Consider what happens if you add, delete or update an element in a collection. For a binary search to continue working, you\u2019d need to maintain the proper sort order. This can be done with the        bisect       module, which you\u2019ll read about in the upcoming section.       You\u2019ll see how to implement the binary search algorithm in Python later on in this tutorial. For now, let\u2019s confront it with the IMDb dataset. Notice that there are different people to search for than before. That\u2019s because the dataset must be sorted for binary search, which reorders the elements. The new elements are located roughly at the same indices as before, to keep the measurements comparable:           Search Term           Element Index           Average Time           Comparisons            (\u2026) Berendse            0            6.52\u00b5s           23            Jonathan Samuangte            4,499,997            6.99\u00b5s           24            Yorgos Rahmatoulin            9,500,001            6.5\u00b5s           23            missing            N/A            7.2\u00b5s           23       The answers are nearly instantaneous. In the average case, it takes only a few microseconds for the binary search to find one element among all nine million! Other than that, the number of comparisons for the chosen elements remains almost constant, which coincides with the following formula:       Finding most elements will require the highest number of comparisons, which can be derived from a logarithm of the size of the collection. Conversely, there\u2019s just one element in the middle that can be found on the first try with one comparison.       Binary search is a great example of a        divide-and-conquer       technique, which partitions one problem into a bunch of smaller problems of the same kind. The individual solutions are then combined to form the final answer. Another well-known example of this technique is the        quicksort       algorithm.         Note:        Don\u2019t confuse divide-and-conquer with          dynamic programming        , which is a somewhat similar technique.       Unlike other search algorithms, binary search can be used beyond just searching. For example, it allows for set membership testing, finding the largest or smallest value, finding the nearest neighbor of the target value, performing range queries, and more.       If speed is a top priority, then binary search is not always the best choice. There are even faster algorithms that can take advantage of hash-based data structures. However, those algorithms require a lot of additional memory, whereas binary search offers a good        space-time tradeoff        Remove ads       Hash-Based Search       To search faster, you need to narrow down the        problem space       . Binary search achieves that goal by halving the number of candidates at each step. That means that even if you have one million elements, it takes at most twenty comparisons to determine if the element is present, provided that all elements are sorted.       The fastest way to search is to know where to find what you\u2019re looking for. If you knew the exact memory location of an element, then you\u2019d access it directly without the need for searching in the first place. Mapping an element or (more commonly) one of its keys to the element location in memory is referred to as        hashing       You can think of hashing not as searching for the specific element, but instead computing the index based on the element itself. That\u2019s the job of a         hash function       , which needs to hold certain mathematical properties. A good hash function should:        Take arbitrary input and turn it into a fixed-size output.        Have a uniform value distribution to mitigate          hash collisions        Produce deterministic results.        Be a         one-way function        Amplify input changes to achieve the         avalanche effect       At the same time, it shouldn\u2019t be too computationally expensive, or else its cost would outweigh the gains. A hash function is also used for data integrity verification as well as in cryptography.       A data structure that uses this concept to map keys into values is called a        map        hash table        dictionary       , or an        associative array         Note:        Python has two built-in data structures, namely         set        and         dict        , which rely on the hash function to find elements. While a         set        hashes its elements, a         dict        uses the hash function against element keys. To find out exactly how a         dict        is implemented in Python, check out Raymond Hettinger\u2019s conference talk on         Modern Python Dictionaries       Another way to visualize hashing is to imagine so-called        buckets       of similar elements grouped under their respective keys. For example, you may be harvesting fruits into different buckets based on color:       The coconut and a kiwi fruit go to the bucket labeled        brown       , while an apple ends up in a bucket with the        red       label, and so on. This allows you to glance through a fraction of the elements quickly. Ideally, you want to have only one fruit in each bucket. Otherwise, you get what\u2019s known as a        collision       , which leads to extra work.         Note:        The buckets, as well as their contents, are typically in no particular order.       Let\u2019s put the names from the IMDb dataset into a dictionary, so that each name becomes a key, and the corresponding value becomes its index:       After loading textual names into a flat list, you can       it inside a        dictionary comprehension       to create the mapping. Now, checking the element\u2019s presence as well as getting its index is straightforward:       Thanks to the hash function used behind the scenes, you don\u2019t have to implement any search at all!       Here\u2019s how the hash-based search algorithm performs against the IMDb dataset:           Search Term           Element Index           Best Time           Average Time           Worst Time            Fred Astaire            0            0.18\u00b5s            0.4\u00b5s            1.9\u00b5s            Alicia Monica            4,500,000            0.17\u00b5s            0.4\u00b5s            2.4\u00b5s            Baoyin Liu            9,500,000            0.17\u00b5s            0.4\u00b5s            2.6\u00b5s            missing            N/A            0.19\u00b5s            0.4\u00b5s            1.7\u00b5s       Not only is the average time an order of magnitude faster than the already fast binary search Python implementation, but the speed is also sustained across all elements regardless of where they are.       The price for that gain is approximately 0.5 GB of more memory consumed by the Python process, slower load time, and the need to keep that additional data consistent with        dictionary       contents. In turn, the lookup is very quick, while updates and insertions are slightly slower when compared to a list.       Another constraint that dictionaries impose on their keys is that they must be        hashable       , and their        hash values       can\u2019t change over time. You can check if a particular data type is hashable in Python by calling       on it:       Mutable collections\u2014such as a        list        set       , and        dict       \u2014aren\u2019t hashable. In practice, dictionary keys should be        immutable       because their hash value often depends on some attributes of the key. If a mutable collection was hashable and could be used as a key, then its hash value would be different every time the contents changed. Consider what would happen if a particular fruit changed color due to ripening. You\u2019d be looking for it in the wrong bucket!       The hash function has many other uses. For example, it\u2019s used in cryptography to avoid storing passwords in plain text form, as well as for data integrity verification.        Remove ads       Using the        bisect       Module       Binary search in Python can be performed using the built-in        bisect       module, which also helps with preserving a list in sorted order. It\u2019s based on the        bisection method       for finding roots of functions. This module comes with six functions divided into two categories:           Find Index           Insert Element       These functions allow you to either find an index of an element or add a new element in the right position. Those in the first row are just aliases for       and       , respectively. In reality, you\u2019re dealing with only four functions.         Note:        It\u2019s your responsibility to sort the list before passing it to one of the functions. If the elements aren\u2019t sorted, then you\u2019ll most likely get incorrect results.       Without further ado, let\u2019s see the        bisect       module in action.       Finding an Element       To find the index of an existing element in a sorted list, you want to       The output tells you that a banana is the second fruit on the list because it was found at index        1       . However, if an element was missing, then you\u2019d still get its expected position:       Even though these fruits aren\u2019t on the list yet, you can get an idea of where to put them. For example, an apricot should come between the apple and the banana, whereas a watermelon should become the last element. You\u2019ll know if an element was found by evaluating two conditions:         Is the          index         within the size of the list?         Is the          value         of the element the desired one?       This can be translated to a universal function for finding elements by value:       When there\u2019s a match, the function will return the corresponding element index. Otherwise, it\u2019ll return        None       implicitly.       To search by key, you have to maintain a separate list of keys. Since this incurs an additional cost, it\u2019s worthwhile to calculate the keys upfront and reuse them as much as possible. You can define a helper class to be able to search by different keys without introducing much code duplication:       The key is a function passed as the first parameter to       . Once you have it, you make a sorted list of key-value pairs to be able to retrieve an element from its key at a later time. Representing pairs with        tuples       guarantees that the first element of each pair will be sorted. In the next step, you extract the keys to make a flat list that\u2019s suitable for your binary search Python implementation.       Then there\u2019s the actual method for finding elements by key:       This code bisects the list of sorted keys to get the index of an element by key. If such a key exists, then its index can be used to get the corresponding pair from the previously computed list of key-value pairs. The second element of that pair is the desired value.         Note:        This is just an illustrative example. You\u2019ll be better off using the         recommended recipe        , which is mentioned in the official documentation.       If you had multiple bananas, then       would return the leftmost instance:       Predictably, to get the rightmost banana, you\u2019d need to call       or its       alias. However, those two functions return one index further from the actual rightmost banana, which is useful for finding the insertion point of a new element:       When you combine the code, you can see how many bananas you have:       If an element were missing, then both       and       would return the same index yielding zero bananas.        Remove ads       Inserting a New Element       Another practical application of the        bisect       module is maintaining the order of elements in an already sorted list. After all, you wouldn\u2019t want to sort the whole list every time you had to insert something into it. In most cases, all three functions can be used interchangeably:       You won\u2019t see any difference until there are        duplicates       in your list. But even then, it won\u2019t become apparent as long as those duplicates are simple values. Adding another banana to the left will have the same effect as adding it to the right.       To notice the difference, you need a data type whose objects can have        unique identities       despite having        equal values       . Let\u2019s define a        Person       type using the        @dataclass        decorator       , which was introduced in Python 3.7:       A person has a        name       and an arbitrary        number       assigned to it. By excluding the        number       field from the equality test, you make two people equal even if they have different values of that attribute:       On the other hand, those two variables refer to completely separate entities, which allows you to make a distinction between them:       The variables        p1       and        p2       are indeed different objects.       Note that instances of a data class aren\u2019t comparable by default, which prevents you from using the bisection algorithm on them:       Python doesn\u2019t know to order        alice       and        bob       , because they\u2019re objects of a custom class. Traditionally, you\u2019d implement the magic method       in your class, which stands for        less than       , to tell the interpreter how to compare such elements. However, the        @dataclass       decorator accepts a few optional Boolean flags. One of them is        order       , which results in an automatic generation of the magic methods for comparison when set to        True       In turn, this allows you to compare two people and decide which one comes first:       Finally, you can take advantage of the        name       and        number       properties to observe where various functions insert new people to the list:       The numbers in parentheses after the names indicate the insertion order. In the beginning, there was just one        John       , who got the number        1       . Then, you added its duplicate to the left, and later one more to the right.        Remove ads       Implementing Binary Search in Python       Keep in mind that you probably shouldn\u2019t implement the algorithm unless you have a strong reason to. You\u2019ll save time and won\u2019t need to reinvent the wheel. The chances are that the library code is mature, already tested by real users in a production environment, and has extensive functionality delivered by multiple contributors.       That said, there are times when it makes sense to roll up your sleeves and do it yourself. Your company might have a policy banning certain open source libraries due to licensing or security matters. Maybe you can\u2019t afford another dependency due to memory or network bandwidth constraints. Lastly, writing code yourself might be a great learning tool!       You can implement most algorithms in two ways:         Iteratively          Recursively       However, there are exceptions to that rule. One notable example is the        Ackermann function       , which can only be expressed in terms of recursion.       Before you go any further, make sure that you have a good grasp of the binary search algorithm. You can refer to an        earlier       part of this tutorial for a quick refresher.       Iteratively       The iterative version of the algorithm involves a loop, which will repeat some steps until the stopping condition is met. Let\u2019s begin by implementing a function that will        search elements by value       and return their index:       You\u2019re going to reuse this function later.       Assuming that all elements are        sorted       , you can set the lower and the upper boundaries at the opposite ends of the sequence:       Now, you want to identify the middle element to see if it has the desired value. Calculating the middle index can be done by taking the average of both boundaries:       Notice how an        integer division       helps to handle both an odd and even number of elements in the bounded range by        flooring       the result. Depending on how you\u2019re going to update the boundaries and define the stopping condition, you could also use a        ceiling function       Next, you either finish or split the sequence in two and continue searching in one of the resultant halves:       If the element in the middle was a match, then you return its index. Otherwise, if it was too small, then you need to move the lower boundary up. If it was too big, then you need to move the upper boundary down.       To keep going, you have to enclose most of the steps in a loop, which will stop when the lower boundary overtakes the upper one:       In other words, you want to iterate as long as the lower boundary is below or equal to the upper one. Otherwise, there was no match, and the function returns        None       implicitly.        Searching by key       boils down to looking at an object\u2019s attributes instead of its literal value. A key could be the number of characters in a fruit\u2019s name, for example. You can adapt       to accept and use a        key       parameter:       However, you must also remember to sort the list using the same        key       that you\u2019re going to search with:       In the example above,        watermelon       was chosen because its name is precisely ten characters long, while no fruits on the list have names made up of three letters.       That\u2019s great, but at the same time, you\u2019ve just lost the ability to search by value. To remedy this, you could assign the        key       a default value of        None       and then check if it was given or not. However, in a more streamlined solution, you\u2019d always want to call the        key       . By default, it would be an        identity function       returning the element itself:       Alternatively, you might define the identity function inline with an anonymous        lambda expression       answers only one question. There are still two others, which are \u201cIs it there?\u201d and \u201cWhat is it?\u201d To answer these two, you can build on top of it:       With these three functions, you can tell almost everything about an element. However, you still haven\u2019t addressed        duplicates       in your implementation. What if you had a collection of people, and some of them shared a common name or surname? For example, there might be a        Smith       family or a few guys going by the name of        John       among the people:       To model the        Person       type, you can modify a data class defined earlier:       Notice the use of the        order       attribute to enable automatic generation of magic methods for comparing instances of the class by all fields. Alternatively, you might prefer to take advantage of the         namedtuple       , which has a shorter syntax:       Both definitions are fine and interchangeable. Each person has a        name       and a        surname       attribute. To sort and search by one of them, you can conveniently define the key function with an       available in the built-in        operator       module:       Notice how people are now sorted by surname in ascending order. There\u2019s        John Smith       and        Alice Smith       , but binary searching for the        Smith       surname currently gives you only one arbitrary result:       To mimic the features of the        bisect       module shown before, you can write your own version of       and       . Before finding the        leftmost       instance of a duplicate element, you want to determine if there\u2019s such an element at all:       If some index has been found, then you can look to the left and keep moving until you come across an element with a different key or there are no more elements:       Once you go past the leftmost element, you need to move the index back by one position to the right.       Finding the        rightmost       instance is quite similar, but you need to flip the conditions:       Instead of going left, now you\u2019re going to the right until the end of the list. Using both functions allows you to find        all occurrences       of duplicate items:       This function always returns a        set       . If the element isn\u2019t found, then the set will be empty. If the element is unique, then the set will be made up of only a single index. Otherwise, there will be multiple indices in the set.       To wrap up, you can define even more abstract functions to complete your binary search Python library:       Not only does this allow you to pinpoint the exact location of elements on the list, but also to retrieve those elements. You\u2019re able to ask very specific questions:           Is it there?           Where is it?           What is it?            contains()       The complete code of this binary search Python library can be found at the link below:         Get Sample Code:         Click here to get the sample code you'll use        to learn about binary search in Python in this tutorial.        Remove ads       Recursively       For the sake of simplicity, you\u2019re only going to consider the        recursive       version of       , which tells you if an element was found.         Note:        My favorite definition of         recursion        was given in an         episode        of the         Fun Fun Function        series about functional programming in JavaScript:         \u201cRecursion is when a function calls itself until it doesn\u2019t.\u201d         \u2014          Mattias Petter Johansson       The most straightforward approach would be to take the iterative version of binary search and use the        slicing operator       to chop the list:       Instead of looping, you check the condition once and sometimes call the same function on a smaller list. What could go wrong with that? Well, it turns out that slicing generates        copies       of element references, which can have noticeable memory and computational overhead.       To avoid copying, you might reuse the same list but pass different boundaries into the function whenever necessary:       The downside is that every time you want to call that function, you have to pass initial boundaries, making sure they\u2019re correct:       If you were to make a mistake, then it would potentially not find that element. You can improve this by using default function arguments or by introducing a helper function that delegates to the recursive one:       Going further, you might prefer to        nest       one function in another to hide the technical details and to take advantage of variable reuse from outer scope:       The       inner function can access both        elements       and        value       parameters even though they\u2019re defined in the enclosing scope. The life cycle and visibility of variables in Python is dictated by the so-called        LEGB       rule, which tells the interpreter to look for symbols in the following order:         Local        scope         Enclosing        scope         Global        scope         Built-in        symbols       This allows variables that are defined in outer scope to be accessed from within nested blocks of code.       The choice between an iterative and a recursive implementation is often the net result of performance considerations, convenience, as well as personal taste. However, there are also certain risks involved with recursion, which is one of the subjects of the next section.       Covering Tricky Details       Here\u2019s what the author of         The Art of Computer Programming       has to say about implementing the binary search algorithm:        \u201cAlthough the basic idea of binary search is comparatively straightforward, the details can be surprisingly tricky, and many good programmers have done it wrong the first few times they tried.\u201d        \u2014 Donald Knuth       If that doesn\u2019t deter you enough from the idea of writing the algorithm yourself, then maybe this will. The standard library in        Java       had a subtle        bug       in their implementation of binary search, which remained undiscovered for a decade! But the bug itself traces its roots much earlier than that.         Note:        I once fell victim to the binary search algorithm during a technical screening. There were a couple of coding puzzles to solve, including a binary search one. Guess which one I failed to complete? Yeah.       The following list isn\u2019t exhaustive, but at the same time, it doesn\u2019t talk about common mistakes like forgetting to sort the list.        Remove ads       Integer Overflow       This is the Java bug that was just mentioned. If you recall, the binary search Python algorithm inspects the middle element of a bounded range in a sorted collection. But how is that middle element chosen exactly? Usually, you take the average of the lower and upper boundary to find the middle index:       This method of calculating the average works just fine in the overwhelming majority of cases. However, once the collection of elements becomes sufficiently large, the sum of both boundaries won\u2019t fit the integer data type. It\u2019ll be larger than the maximum value allowed for integers.       Some programming languages might raise an error in such situations, which would immediately stop program execution. Unfortunately, that\u2019s not always the case. For example, Java silently ignores this problem, letting the value flip around and become some seemingly random number. You\u2019ll only know about the problem as long as the resulting number happens to be negative, which throws an        IndexOutOfBoundsException       Here\u2019s an example that demonstrates this behavior in        jshell       , which is kind of like an interactive interpreter for Java:       A safer way to find the middle index could be calculating the offset first and then adding it to the lower boundary:       Even if both values are maxed out, the sum in the formula above will never be. There are a few more ways, but the good news is that you don\u2019t need to worry about any of these, because Python is free from the integer overflow error. There\u2019s no upper limit on how big integers can be other than your memory:<span class=\"go\">210624582650556372047028295576838759252690170086892944262392971263</span>       However, there\u2019s a catch. When you call functions from a library, that code might be subject to the C language constraints and still cause an overflow. There are plenty of libraries based on the C language in Python. You could even build your own        C extension module       or load a dynamically-linked library into Python using         ctypes       Stack Overflow       The        stack overflow       problem may, theoretically, concern the recursive implementation of binary search. Most programming languages impose a limit on the number of nested function calls. Each call is associated with a return address stored on a stack. In Python, the default limit is a few thousand levels of such calls:       This won\u2019t be enough for a lot of recursive functions. However, it\u2019s very unlikely that a binary search in Python would ever need more due to its logarithmic nature. You\u2019d need a collection of two to the power of three thousand elements. That\u2019s a number with over        nine hundred       digits!       Nevertheless, it\u2019s still possible for the        infinite recursion error       to arise if the stopping condition is stated incorrectly due to a bug. In such a case, the infinite recursion will eventually cause a stack overflow.         Note:        The         stack overflow error        is very common among languages with manual memory management. People would often google those errors to see if someone else already had similar issues, which gave the name to a popular         Q&amp;A site        for programmers.       You can temporarily lift or decrease the recursion limit to simulate a stack overflow error. Note that the effective limit will be smaller because of the functions that the Python runtime environment has to call:       The recursive function was called three times before saturating the stack. The remaining four calls must have been made by the interactive interpreter. If you run that same code in        PyCharm       or an alternative Python shell, then you might get a different result.       Duplicate Elements       You\u2019re aware of the possibility of having duplicate elements in the list and you know how to deal with them. This is just to emphasize that a conventional binary search in Python might not produce deterministic results. Depending on how the list was sorted or how many elements it has, you\u2019ll get a different answer:       There are two bananas on the list. At first, the call to       returns the left one. However, adding a completely unrelated element at the end of the list makes the same call give you a different        banana       The same principle, known as        algorithm stability       , applies to sorting algorithms. Some are stable, meaning they don\u2019t change the relative positions of equivalent elements. Others don\u2019t make such guarantees. If you ever need to sort elements by multiple criteria, then you should always start from the least significant key to retain stability.       Floating-Point Rounding       So far you\u2019ve only searched for fruits or people, but what about numbers? They should be no different, right? Let\u2019s make a list of floating-point numbers at        0.1       increments using a        list comprehension       The list should contain numbers the        one-tenth        two-tenths       , and        three-tenths       . Surprisingly, only two of those three numbers can be found:       This isn\u2019t a problem strictly related to binary search in Python, as the built-in linear search is consistent with it:       It\u2019s not even a problem related to Python but rather to how floating-point numbers are        represented       in computer memory. This is defined by the IEEE 754 standard for floating-point arithmetic. Without going into much detail, some decimal numbers don\u2019t have a finite representation in binary form. Because of limited memory, those numbers get        rounded       , causing a        floating-point rounding error         Note:        If you require maximum precision, then steer away from floating-point numbers. They\u2019re great for engineering purposes. However, for monetary operations, you don\u2019t want rounding errors to accumulate. It\u2019s recommended to scale down all prices and amounts to the smallest unit, such as cents or pennies, and treat them as integers.        Alternatively, many programming languages have support for         fixed-point numbers        , such as the         decimal        type in Python. This puts you in control of when and how rounding is taking place.       If you do need to work with floating-point numbers, then you should replace exact matching with an        approximate comparison       . Let\u2019s consider two variables with slightly different values:       Regular comparison gives a negative result, although both values are nearly identical. Fortunately, Python comes with a function that will test if two values are close to each other within some small neighborhood:       That neighborhood, which is the maximum distance between the values, can be adjusted if needed:       You can use that function to do a binary search in Python in the following way:       On the other hand, this implementation of binary search in Python is specific to floating-point numbers only. You couldn\u2019t use it to search for anything else without getting an error.       Analyzing the Time-Space Complexity of Binary Search       The following section will contain no code and some math concepts.       In computing, you can optimize the performance of pretty much any algorithm at the expense of increased memory use. For instance, you saw that a hash-based search of the IMDb dataset required an extra 0.5 GB of memory to achieve unparalleled speed.       Conversely, to save bandwidth, you\u2019d compress a video stream before sending it over the network, increasing the amount of work to be done. This phenomenon is known as the        space-time tradeoff       and is useful in evaluating an algorithm\u2019s        complexity       Time-Space Complexity       The computational complexity is a        relative       measure of how many resources an algorithm needs to do its job. The resources include        computation time       as well as the amount of        memory       it uses. Comparing the complexity of various algorithms allows you to make an informed decision about which is better in a given situation.         Note:        Algorithms that don\u2019t need to allocate more memory than their input data already consumes are called         in-place        , or         in-situ        , algorithms. This results in mutating the original data, which sometimes may have unwanted side-effects.       You looked at a few search algorithms and their average performance against a large dataset. It\u2019s clear from those measurements that a binary search is faster than a linear search. You can even tell by what factor.       However, if you took the same measurements in a different environment, you\u2019d probably get slightly or perhaps entirely different results. There are invisible factors at play that can be influencing your test. Besides, such measurements aren\u2019t always feasible. So, how can you compare time complexities quickly and objectively?       The first step is to break down the algorithm into smaller pieces and find the one that is doing the most work. It\u2019s likely going to be some        elementary operation       that gets called a lot and consistently takes about the same time to run. For search algorithms, such an operation might be the comparison of two elements.       Having established that, you can now analyze the algorithm. To find the time complexity, you want to describe the        relationship       between the number of elementary operations executed versus the size of the input. Formally, such a relationship is a mathematical function. However, you\u2019re not interested in looking for its exact algebraic formula but rather        estimating       its overall shape.       There are a few well-known classes of functions that most algorithms fit in. Once you classify an algorithm according to one of them, you can put it on a scale:        Common Classes of Time Complexity       These classes tell you how the number of elementary operations increases with the growing size of the input. They are, from left to right:        Constant        Logarithmic        Linear        Quasilinear        Quadratic        Exponential        Factorial       This can give you an idea about the performance of the algorithm you\u2019re considering. A constant complexity, regardless of the input size, is the most desired one. A logarithmic complexity is still pretty good, indicating a divide-and-conquer technique at use. The further to the right on this scale, the worse the complexity of the algorithm, because it has more work to do.       When you\u2019re talking about the time complexity, what you typically mean is the        asymptotic complexity       , which describes the behavior under very large data sets. This simplifies the function formula by eliminating all terms and coefficients but the one that grows at the fastest rate (for example, n squared).       However, a single function doesn\u2019t provide enough information to compare two algorithms accurately. The time complexity may vary depending on the volume of data. For example, the binary search algorithm is like a turbocharged engine, which builds pressure before it\u2019s ready to deliver power. On the other hand, the linear search algorithm is fast from the start but quickly reaches its peak power and ultimately loses the race:       In terms of speed, the binary search algorithm starts to overtake the linear search when there\u2019s a certain number of elements in the collection. For smaller collections, a linear search might be a better choice.         Note:        Note that the same algorithm may have different         optimistic         pessimistic        , and         average        time complexity. For example, in the best-case scenario, a linear search algorithm will find the element at the first index, after running just one comparison.        On the other end of the spectrum, it\u2019ll have to compare a reference value to all elements in the collection. In practice, you want to know the pessimistic complexity of an algorithm.       There are a few mathematical notations of the asymptotic complexity, which are used to compare algorithms. By far the most popular one is the        Big-O notation       The Big-O Notation       The         Big-O notation       represents the worst-case scenario of asymptotic complexity. Although this might sound rather intimidating, you don\u2019t need to know the formal definition. Intuitively, it\u2019s a very rough measure of the rate of growth at the tail of the function that describes the complexity. You pronounce it as \u201c        big-oh\u201d of something       That \u201csomething\u201d is usually a function of data size or just the digit \u201cone\u201d that stands for a constant. For example, the linear search algorithm has a time complexity of       , while a hash-based search has       complexity.         Note:        When you say that some algorithm has complexity        , where         n        is the size of the input data, then it means that the function        is an upper bound of the graph of that complexity. In other words, the actual complexity of that algorithm won\u2019t grow faster than        multiplied by some constant, when         n        approaches infinity.       In real-life, the Big-O notation is used less formally as both an upper and a lower bound. This is useful for the classification and comparison of algorithms without having to worry about the exact function formulas.       The Complexity of Binary Search       You\u2019ll estimate the asymptotic time complexity of binary search by determining the number of comparisons in the worst-case scenario\u2014when an element is missing\u2014as a function of input size. You can approach this problem in three different ways:        Tabular        Graphical        Analytical       The        tabular       method is about collecting empirical data, putting it in a table, and trying to guess the formula by eyeballing sampled values:           Number of Elements           Number of Comparisons           0           0           1           1           2           2           3           2           4           3           5           3           6           3           7           3           8           4       The number of comparisons grows as you increase the number of elements in the collection, but the rate of growth is slower than if it was a linear function. That\u2019s an indication of a good algorithm that can scale with data.       If that doesn\u2019t help you, you can try the        graphical       method, which visualizes the sampled data by drawing a graph:       The data points seem to overlay with a curve, but you don\u2019t have enough information to provide a conclusive answer. It could be a        polynomial       , whose graph turns up and down for larger inputs.       Taking the        analytical       approach, you can choose some relationship and look for patterns. For example, you might study how the number of elements shrinks in each step of the algorithm:           Comparison           Number of Elements           -           n           1st           n/2           2nd           n/4           3rd           n/8           \u22ee           \u22ee           k-th           n/2            k       In the beginning, you start with the whole collection of        n       elements. After the first comparison, you\u2019re left with only half of them. Next, you have a quarter, and so on. The pattern that arises from this observation is that after        k-th       comparison, there are        n/2         k       elements. Variable        k       is the expected number of elementary operations.       After all        k       comparisons, there will be no more elements left. However, when you take one step back, that is        k - 1       , there will be exactly one element left. This gives you a convenient equation:       Multiply both sides of the equation by the denominator, then take the logarithm base two of the result, and move the remaining constant to the right. You\u2019ve just found the formula for the binary search complexity, which is on the order of       Conclusion       Now you know the binary search algorithm inside and out. You can flawlessly implement it yourself, or take advantage of the standard library in Python. Having tapped into the concept of time-space complexity, you\u2019re able to choose the best search algorithm for the given situation.

This will raise a         KeyError       and break up your code execution. To handle these kinds of situations, the        standard library       provides the Python         defaultdict       type, a dictionary-like class that\u2019s available for you in         collections       The Python         defaultdict       type behaves almost exactly like a regular Python dictionary, but if you try to access or modify a missing key, then        defaultdict       will automatically create the key and generate a default value for it. This makes        defaultdict       a valuable option for handling missing keys in dictionaries.        In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn:        How to use the Python         defaultdict        type for         handling missing keys        in a dictionary        When and why to use a Python         defaultdict        rather than a regular          dict        How to use a         defaultdict        for         grouping         counting        , and         accumulating        operations       With this knowledge under your belt, you\u2019ll be in a better condition to effectively use the Python        defaultdict       type in your day-to-day programming challenges.       To get the most out of this tutorial, you should have some previous understanding of what Python        dictionaries       are and how to work with them.

Remove ads       Handling Missing Keys in Dictionaries       A common issue that you can face when working with Python dictionaries is        how to handle missing keys       . If your code is heavily based on dictionaries, or if you\u2019re creating dictionaries on the fly all the time, then you\u2019ll soon notice that dealing with frequent         KeyError        exceptions       can be quite annoying and can add extra complexity to your code. With Python dictionaries, you have at least four available ways to handle missing keys:        Use        Use        Use the         key in dict        idiom        Use a          try        and         except        block       The        Python docs       explain       and       as follows:        If         key        is in the dictionary, return its value. If not, insert         key        with a value of         default        and return         default         default        defaults to         None        Return the value for         key        if         key        is in the dictionary, else         default        . If         default        is not given, it defaults to         None        , so that this method never raises a          KeyError         Source       Here\u2019s an example of how you can use       to handle missing keys in a dictionary:       In the above code, you use       to generate a default value for        missing_key       . Notice that your dictionary,        a_dict       , now has a new key called        missing_key       whose value is        'default value'       . This key didn\u2019t exist before you called       . Finally, if you call       on an existing key, then the call won\u2019t have any effect on the dictionary. Your key will hold the original value instead of the new default value.         Note:        In the above code example, you get an exception, and Python shows you a         traceback        message, which tells you that you\u2019re trying to access a missing key in         a_dict        . If you want to dive deeper into how to decipher and understand a Python traceback, then check out         Understanding the Python Traceback       On the other hand, if you use       , then you can code something like this:       Here, you use       to generate a default value for        missing_key       , but this time, your dictionary stays empty. This is because       returns the default value, but this value isn\u2019t added to the underlying dictionary. For example, if you have a dictionary called        D       , then you can assume that       works something like this:       With this pseudo-code, you can understand how       works internally. If the key exists, then       returns the value mapped to that key. Otherwise, the default value is returned. Your code never creates or assigns a value to        key       . In this example,        default       defaults to        None       You can also use        conditional statements       to handle missing keys in dictionaries. Take a look at the following example, which uses the        key in dict       idiom:       In this code, you use an        if       statement along with the         in        operator       to check if        key       is present in        a_dict       . If so, then you can perform any action with        key       or with its value. Otherwise, you create the new key,        key       , and assign it a        'default value'       . Note that the above code works similar to       but takes four lines of code, while       would only take one line (in addition to being more readable).       You can also walk around the        KeyError       by using a        try       and        except       block to handle the exception. Consider the following piece of code:       The        try       and        except       block in the above example catches the        KeyError       whenever you try to get access to a missing key. In the        except       clause, you create the        key       and assign it a        'default value'         Note:        If missing keys are uncommon in your code, then you might prefer to use a         try        and         except        block (         EAFP coding style        ) to catch the         KeyError        exception. This is because the code doesn\u2019t check the existence of every key and only handles a few exceptions, if any.        On the other hand, if missing keys are quite common in your code, then the conditional statement (         LBYL coding style        ) can be a better choice because checking for keys can be less costly than handling frequent exceptions.       So far, you\u2019ve learned how to handle missing keys using the tools that        dict       and Python offer you. However, the examples you saw here are quite verbose and hard to read. They might not be as straightforward as you might want. That\u2019s why the        Python standard library       provides a more elegant,        Pythonic       , and efficient solution. That solution is         collections.defaultdict       , and that\u2019s what you\u2019ll be covering from now on.        Remove ads       Understanding the Python        defaultdict       Type       The Python standard library provides         collections       , which is a module that implements specialized container types. One of those is the Python        defaultdict       type, which is an alternative to        dict       that\u2019s specifically designed to help you out with missing keys.        defaultdict       is a Python type that inherits from        dict       The above code shows that the Python        defaultdict       type is a        subclass       of        dict       . This means that        defaultdict       inherits most of the behavior of        dict       . So, you can say that        defaultdict       is much like an ordinary dictionary.       The main difference between        defaultdict       and        dict       is that when you try to access or modify a        key       that\u2019s not present in the dictionary, a default        value       is automatically given to that        key       . In order to provide this functionality, the Python        defaultdict       type does two things:        It overrides        It adds         .default_factory        , a writable instance variable that needs to be provided at the time of instantiation.       The instance variable        .default_factory       will hold the first argument passed into       . This argument can take a valid Python callable or        None       . If a callable is provided, then it\u2019ll automatically be called by        defaultdict       whenever you try to access or modify the value associated with a missing key.         Note:        All the remaining arguments to the class initializer are treated as if they were passed to the initializer of regular         dict        , including the keyword arguments.       Take a look at how you can create and properly initialize a        defaultdict       Here, you pass         list       to        .default_factory       when you create the dictionary. Then, you use        def_dict       just like a regular dictionary. Note that when you try to access or modify the value mapped to a non-existent key, the dictionary assigns it the default value that results from calling       Keep in mind that you must pass a valid Python callable object to        .default_factory       , so remember not to call it using the parentheses at initialization time. This can be a common issue when you start using the Python        defaultdict       type. Take a look at the following code:       Here, you try to create a        defaultdict       by passing       to        .default_factory       . The call to       raises a        TypeError       , which tells you that the first argument must be callable or        None       With this introduction to the Python        defaultdict       type, you can get start coding with practical examples. The next few sections will walk you through some common use cases where you can rely on a        defaultdict       to provide an elegant, efficient, and Pythonic solution.       Using the Python        defaultdict       Type       Sometimes, you\u2019ll use a mutable built-in collection (a        list        dict       , or         set       ) as values in your Python dictionaries. In these cases, you\u2019ll need to        initialize the keys       before first use, or you\u2019ll get a        KeyError       . You can either do this process manually or automate it using a Python        defaultdict       . In this section, you\u2019ll learn how to use the Python        defaultdict       type for solving some common programming problems:         Grouping        the items in a collection         Counting        the items in a collection         Accumulating        the values in a collection       You\u2019ll be covering some examples that use        list        set        int       , and        float       to perform grouping, counting, and accumulating operations in a user-friendly and efficient way.       Grouping Items       A typical use of the Python        defaultdict       type is to set        .default_factory       to        list       and then build a dictionary that maps keys to lists of values. With this        defaultdict       , if you try to get access to any missing key, then the dictionary runs the following steps:         Call        to create a new empty         list         Insert        the empty         list        into the dictionary using the missing key as         key         Return        a reference to that         list       This allows you to write code like this:       Here, you create a Python        defaultdict       called        dd       and pass        list       to        .default_factory       . Notice that even when        key       isn\u2019t defined, you can append values to it without getting a        KeyError       . That\u2019s because        dd       automatically calls        .default_factory       to generate a default value for the missing        key       You can use        defaultdict       along with        list       to group the items in a sequence or a collection. Suppose that you\u2019ve retrieved the following data from your company\u2019s database:           Department           Employee Name           Sales           John Doe           Sales           Martin Smith           Accounting           Jane Doe           Marketing           Elizabeth Smith           Marketing           Adam Doe           \u2026           \u2026       With this data, you create an initial        list       of         tuple       objects like the following:       Now, you need to create a dictionary that groups the employees by department. To do this, you can use a        defaultdict       as follows:       Here, you create a        defaultdict       called        dep_dd       and use a         for        loop       to iterate through your        dep       list. The statement       creates the keys for the departments, initializes them to an empty list, and then appends the employees to each department. Once you run this code, your        dep_dd       will look something like this:       In this example, you group the employees by their department using a        defaultdict       with        .default_factory       set to        list       . To do this with a regular dictionary, you can use       as follows:       This code is straightforward, and you\u2019ll find similar code quite often in your work as a Python coder. However, the        defaultdict       version is arguably more readable, and for large datasets, it can also be a lot        faster and more efficient       . So, if speed is a concern for you, then you should consider using a        defaultdict       instead of a standard        dict        Remove ads       Grouping Unique Items       Continue working with the data of departments and employees from the previous section. After some processing, you realize that a few employees have been        duplicated       in the database by mistake. You need to clean up the data and remove the duplicated employees from your        dep_dd       dictionary. To do this, you can use a        set       as the        .default_factory       and rewrite your code as follows:       In this example, you set        .default_factory       to        set        Sets       are        collections of unique objects       , which means that you can\u2019t create a        set       with repeated items. This is a really interesting feature of sets, which guarantees that you won\u2019t have repeated items in your final dictionary.       Counting Items       If you set        .default_factory       to         int       , then your        defaultdict       will be useful for        counting the items       in a sequence or collection. When you call       with no arguments, the function returns        0       , which is the typical value you\u2019d use to initialize a counter.       To continue with the example of the company database, suppose you want to build a dictionary that counts the number of employees per department. In this case, you can code something like this:       Here, you set        .default_factory       to        int       . When you call       with no argument, the returned value is        0       . You can use this default value to start counting the employees that work in each department. For this code to work correctly, you need a clean dataset. There must be no repeated data. Otherwise, you\u2019ll need to filter out the repeated employees.       Another example of counting items is the        mississippi       example, where you count the number of times each letter in a word is repeated. Take a look at the following code:       In the above code, you create a        defaultdict       with        .default_factory       set to        int       . This sets the default value for any given key to        0       . Then, you use a        for       loop to traverse the        string        s       and use an        augmented assignment operation       to add        1       to the counter in every iteration. The keys of        dd       will be the letters in        mississippi         Note:        Python\u2019s         augmented assignment operators        are a handy shortcut to common operations.        Take a look at the following examples:         is equivalent to          var = var + 1         is equivalent to          var = var - 1         is equivalent to          var = var * 1        This is just a sample of how the augmented assignment operators work. You can take a look at the         official documentation        to learn more about this feature.       As counting is a relatively common task in programming, the Python dictionary-like class         collections.Counter       is specially designed for counting items in a sequence. With        Counter       , you can write the        mississippi       example as follows:       In this case,        Counter       does all the work for you! You only need to pass in a sequence, and the dictionary will count its items, storing them as keys and the counts as values. Note that this example works because Python strings are also a sequence type.       Accumulating Values       Sometimes you\u2019ll need to calculate the        total sum       of the values in a sequence or collection. Let\u2019s say you have the following        Excel sheet       with data about the sales of your Python website:           Products           July           August           September           Books           1250.00           1300.00           1420.00           Tutorials           560.00           630.00           750.00           Courses           2500.00           2430.00           2750.00       Next, you process the data using Python and get the following        list       of        tuple       objects:       With this data, you want to calculate the total income per product. To do that, you can use a Python        defaultdict       with        float       as        .default_factory       and then code something like this:       Here\u2019s what this code does:         In line 1        , you import the Python         defaultdict        type.         In line 3        , you create a         defaultdict        object with         .default_factory        set to         float         In line 4        , you define a         for        loop to iterate through the items of         incomes         In line 5        , you use an augmented assignment operation (        ) to accumulate the incomes per product in the dictionary.       The second loop iterates through the items of        dd       and prints the incomes to your screen.         Note:        If you want to dive deeper into dictionary iteration, check out         How to Iterate Through a Dictionary in Python       If you put all this code into a file called        incomes.py       and run it from your command line, then you\u2019ll get the following output:       You now have a summary of incomes per product, so you can make decisions on which strategy to follow for increasing the total income of your site.        Remove ads       Diving Deeper Into        defaultdict       So far, you\u2019ve learned how to use the Python        defaultdict       type by coding some practical examples. At this point, you can dive deeper into        type implementation       and other working details. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll be covering in the next few sections.        defaultdict       vs        dict       For you to better understand the Python        defaultdict       type, a good exercise would be to compare it with its superclass,        dict       . If you want to know the methods and attributes that are specific to the Python        defaultdict       type, then you can run the following line of code:       In the above code, you use       to get the list of valid attributes for        dict       and        defaultdict       . Then, you use a         set       difference to get the set of methods and attributes that you can only find in        defaultdict       . As you can see, the differences between these two classes are. You have two methods and one instance attribute. The following table shows what the methods and the attribute are for:           Method or Attribute           Description           Provides support for            .default_factory           Holds the callable invoked by           to automatically provide default values for missing keys           Gets called when           can\u2019t find            key       In the above table, you can see the methods and the attribute that make a        defaultdict       different from a regular        dict       . The rest of the methods are the same in both classes.         Note:        If you initialize a         defaultdict        using a valid callable, then you won\u2019t get a         KeyError        when you try to get access to a missing key. Any key that doesn\u2019t exist gets the value returned by         .default_factory       Additionally, you might notice that a        defaultdict       is equal to a        dict       with the same items:       Here, you create a regular dictionary        std_dict       with some arbitrary items. Then, you create a        defaultdict       with the same items. If you test both dictionaries for content equality, then you\u2019ll see that they\u2019re equal.        defaultdict.default_factory       The first argument to the Python        defaultdict       type must be a        callable       that takes no arguments and returns a value. This argument is assigned to the instance attribute,        .default_factory       . For this, you can use any callable, including functions, methods, classes, type objects, or any other valid callable. The default value of        .default_factory       is        None       If you instantiate        defaultdict       without passing a value to        .default_factory       , then the dictionary will behave like a regular        dict       and the usual        KeyError       will be raised for missing key lookup or modification attempts:       Here, you instantiate the Python        defaultdict       type with no arguments. In this case, the instance behaves like a standard dictionary. So, if you try to access or modify a missing key, then you\u2019ll get the usual        KeyError       . From this point on, you can use        dd       as a normal Python dictionary and, unless you assign a new callable to        .default_factory       , you won\u2019t be able to use the ability of        defaultdict       to handle missing keys automatically.       If you pass        None       to the first argument of        defaultdict       , then the instance will behave the same way you saw in the above example. That\u2019s because        .default_factory       defaults to        None       , so both initializations are equivalent. On the other hand, if you pass a valid callable object to        .default_factory       , then you can use it to handle missing keys in a user-friendly way. Here\u2019s an example where you pass        list       to        .default_factory       In this example, you create a Python        defaultdict       called        dd       , then you use        list       for its first argument. The second argument is called        letters       and holds a list of letters. You see that        .default_factory       now holds a        list       object that will be called when you need to supply a default        value       for any missing key.       Notice that when you try to access        numbers        dd       tests if        numbers       is in the dictionary. If it\u2019s not, then it calls       . Since        .default_factory       holds a        list       object, the returned        value       is an empty list (       Now that       is initialized with an empty        list       , you can use       to add elements to the        list       . You can also use an augmented assignment operator (       ) to concatenate the lists       and       . This way, you can handle missing keys in a more Pythonic and more efficient way.       On the other hand, if you pass a        non-callable       object to the initializer of the Python        defaultdict       type, then you\u2019ll get a        TypeError       like in the following code:       Here, you pass        0       to        .default_factory       . Since        0       is not a callable object, you get a        TypeError       telling you that the first argument must be callable or        None        defaultdict       doesn\u2019t work.       Keep in mind that        .default_factory       is only called from       and not from other methods. This means that if        dd       is a        defaultdict       and        key       is a missing key, then       will call        .default_factory       to provide a default        value       , but       still returns        None       instead of the value that        .default_factory       would provide. That\u2019s because       doesn\u2019t call       to retrieve the        key       Take a look at the following code:       In this code fragment, you can see that       returns        None       rather than the default value that        .default_factory       would provide. That\u2019s because        .default_factory       is only called from       , which is not called by       Notice that you can also add        arbitrary values       to a Python        defaultdict       . This means that you\u2019re not limited to values with the same type as the values generated by        .default_factory       . Here\u2019s an example:       Here, you create a        defaultdict       and pass in a        list       object to        .default_factory       . This sets your default values to be empty lists. However, you can freely add a new key that holds values of a different type. That\u2019s the case with the key        string       , which holds a        str       object instead of a        list       object.       Finally, you can always        change or update the callable       you initially assign to        .default_factory       in the same way you would do with any instance attribute:       In the above code, you change        .default_factory       from        list       to        str       . Now, whenever you try to get access to a missing key, your default value will be an empty string (       Depending on your use cases for the Python        defaultdict       type, you might need to freeze the dictionary once you finish creating it and make it read-only. To do this, you can set        .default_factory       to        None       after you finish populating the dictionary. This way, your dictionary will behave like a standard        dict       , which means you won\u2019t have more automatically generated default values.        Remove ads        defaultdict       vs       As you saw before,        dict       provides       , which will allow you to assign values to missing keys on the fly. In contrast, with a        defaultdict       you can specify the default value up front when you initialize the container. You can use       to assign default values as follows:       In this code, you create a regular dictionary and then use       to assign a value (       ) to the key        missing_key       , which wasn\u2019t defined yet.         Note:        You can assign any type of Python object using        . This is an important difference compared to         defaultdict        if you consider that         defaultdict        only accepts a callable or         None       On the other hand, if you use a        defaultdict       to accomplish the same task, then the default value is generated on demand whenever you try to access or modify a missing key. Notice that, with        defaultdict       , the default value is generated by the callable you pass upfront to the initializer of the class. Here\u2019s how it works:       Here, you first import the Python        defaultdict       type from        collections       . Then, you create a        defaultdict       and pass        list       to        .default_factory       . When you try to get access to a missing key,        defaultdict       internally calls       , which holds a reference to        list       , and assigns the resulting value (an empty        list       ) to        missing_key       The code in the above two examples does the same work, but the        defaultdict       version is arguably more readable, user-friendly, Pythonic, and straightforward.         Note:        A call to a built-in type like         list         set         dict         str         int        , or         float        will return an empty object or zero for numeric types.        Take a look at the following code examples:        In this code, you call some built-in types with no arguments and get an empty object or zero for the numeric types.       Finally, using a        defaultdict       to handle missing keys can be faster than using       . Take a look a the following example:       If you        run the script       from your system\u2019s command line, then you\u2019ll get something like this:       Here, you use       to measure the execution time of       and       . These functions perform equivalent actions, but the first uses       , and the second uses a        defaultdict       . The time measure will depend on your current hardware, but you can see here that        defaultdict       is faster than       . This difference can become more important as the dataset gets larger.       Additionally, you need to consider that creating a regular        dict       can be faster than creating a        defaultdict       . Take a look at this code:       This time, you use       to measure the execution time of        dict       and        defaultdict       instantiation. Notice that creating a        dict       takes almost half the time of creating a        defaultdict       . This might not be a problem if you consider that, in real-world code, you normally instantiate        defaultdict       only once.       Also notice that, by default,       will run your code a million times. That\u2019s the reason for defining        std_dict       and        def_dict       out of the scope of       and       in       . Otherwise, the time measure will be affected by the instantiation time of        dict       and        defaultdict       At this point, you may have an idea of when to use a        defaultdict       rather than a regular        dict       . Here are three things to take into account:          If your code is heavily base on dictionaries         and you\u2019re dealing with missing keys all the time, then you should consider using a          defaultdict         rather than a regular          dict          If your dictionary items need to be initialized         with a constant default value, then you should consider using a          defaultdict         instead of a          dict          If your code relies on dictionaries         for aggregating, accumulating, counting, or grouping values, and performance is a concern, then you should consider using a          defaultdict       You can consider the above guidelines when deciding whether to use a        dict       or a        defaultdict        Remove ads       Behind the scenes, the Python        defaultdict       type works by calling        .default_factory       to supply default values to missing keys. The mechanism that makes this possible is       , a special method supported by all the standard mapping types, including        dict       and        defaultdict         Note:        Note that        is automatically called by        to handle missing keys and that        is automatically called by Python at the same time for         subscription operations        like       So, how does       work? If you set        .default_factory       to        None       , then       raises a        KeyError       with the        key       as an argument. Otherwise,        .default_factory       is called without arguments to provide a default        value       for the given        key       . This        value       is inserted into the dictionary and finally returned. If calling        .default_factory       raises an exception, then the exception is propagated unchanged.       The following code shows a viable Python implementation for       Here\u2019s what this code does:         In line 1        , you define the method and its signature.         In lines 2 and 3        , you test to see if         .default_factory        is         None        . If so, then you raise a         KeyError        with the         key        as an argument.         In lines 4 and 5        , you check if the         key        is not in the dictionary. If it\u2019s not, then you call         .default_factory        and assign its return value to the         key         In line 6        , you return the         key        as expected.       Keep in mind that the presence of       in a mapping has no effect on the behavior of other methods that look up keys, such as       or       , which implements the        in       operator. That\u2019s because       is only called by       when the requested        key       is not found in the dictionary. Whatever       returns or raises is then returned or raised by       Now that you\u2019ve covered an alternative Python implementation for       , it would be a good exercise to try to emulate        defaultdict       with some Python code. That\u2019s what you\u2019ll be doing in the next section.       Emulating the Python        defaultdict       Type       In this section, you\u2019ll be coding a Python class that will behave much like a        defaultdict       . To do that, you\u2019ll subclass         collections.UserDict       and then add       . Also, you need to add an instance attribute called        .default_factory       , which will hold the callable for generating default values on demand. Here\u2019s a piece of code that emulates most of the behavior of the Python        defaultdict       type:       Here\u2019s how this code works:          In line 1         , you import          collections         to get access to          UserDict          In line 3         , you create a class that subclasses          UserDict          In line 4         , you define the class initializer         . This method takes an argument called          default_factory         to hold the callable that you\u2019ll use to generate the default values. Notice that          default_factory         defaults to          None         , just like in a          defaultdict         . You also need the           *args          and         for emulating the normal behavior of a regular          dict          In line 5         , you call the superclass         . This means that you\u2019re calling         and passing          *args         and         to it.          In line 6         , you first check if          default_factory         is a valid callable object. In this case, you use           callable(object)         , which is a built-in function that returns          True         if          object         appears to be a callable and otherwise returns          False         . This check ensures that you can call         if you need to generate a default          value         for any missing          key         . Then, you check if          .default_factory         is not          None          In line 7         , you raise a          TypeError         just like a regular          dict         would do if          default_factory         is          None          In line 8         , you initialize          .default_factory          In line 10         , you define         , which is implemented as you saw before. Recall that         is automatically called by         when a given          key         is not in a dictionary.       If you feel in the mood to read some        C       code, then you can take a look at the        full code       for the Python        defaultdict       Type in the        CPython source code       Now that you\u2019ve finished coding this class, you can test it by putting the code into a Python script called       and importing it from an interactive session. Here\u2019s an example:       Here, you first import        my_defaultdict       from        my_dd       . Then, you create an instance of        my_defaultdict       and pass        list       to        .default_factory       . If you try to get access to a key with a subscription operation, like       , then       is automatically called by Python. If the key is not in the dictionary, then       is called, which generates a default value by calling       You can also change the callable assigned to        .default_factory       using a normal assignment operation like in       . Finally, if you pass        None       to        .default_factory       , then you\u2019ll get a        KeyError       when trying to retrieve a missing key.         Note:        The behavior of a         defaultdict        is essentially the same as this Python equivalent. However, you\u2019ll soon note that your Python implementation doesn\u2019t print as a real         defaultdict        but as a standard         dict        . You can modify this detail by overriding        and       You may be wondering why you subclass        collections.UserDict       instead of a regular        dict       for this example. The main reason for this is that subclassing built-in types can be error-prone because the C code of the built-ins doesn\u2019t seem to consistently call special methods overridden by the user.       Here\u2019s an example that shows some issues that you can face when subclassing        dict       In this example, you create        MyDict       , which is a class that subclasses        dict       . Your implementation of       always sets values to        None       . If you create an instance of        MyDict       and pass a keyword argument to its initializer, then you\u2019ll notice the class is not calling your       to handle the assignment. You know that because the key        first       wasn\u2019t assigned        None       By contrast, if you run a subscription operation like       , then you\u2019ll notice that        second       is set to        None       rather than to        2       . So, this time you can say that subscription operations call your custom       . Finally, notice that       doesn\u2019t call       either, because your        third       key ends up with a value of        3         UserDict       doesn\u2019t inherit from        dict       but simulates the behavior of a standard dictionary. The class has an internal        dict       instance called        .data       , which is used to store the content of the dictionary.        UserDict       is a more reliable class when it comes to creating        custom mappings       . If you use        UserDict       , then you\u2019ll be avoiding the issues you saw before. To prove this, go back to the code for        my_defaultdict       and add the following method:       Here, you add a custom       that calls the superclass       , which always sets the value to        None       . Update this code in your script       and import it from an interactive session as follows:       In this case, when you instantiate        my_defaultdict       and pass        first       to the class initializer, your custom       gets called. Also, when you assign a value to the key        second       gets called as well. You now have a        my_defaultdict       that consistently calls your custom special methods. Notice that all the values in the dictionary are equal to        None       now.        Remove ads       Passing Arguments to        .default_factory       As you saw earlier,        .default_factory       must be set to a callable object that takes no argument and returns a value. This value will be used to supply a default value for any missing key in the dictionary. Even when        .default_factory       shouldn\u2019t take arguments, Python offers some tricks that you can use if you need to supply arguments to it. In this section, you\u2019ll cover two Python tools that can serve this purpose:          lambda       With these two tools, you can add extra flexibility to the Python        defaultdict       type. For example, you can initialize a        defaultdict       with a callable that takes an argument and, after some processing, you can update the callable with a new argument to change the default value for the keys you\u2019ll create from this point on.       Using        lambda       A flexible way to pass arguments to        .default_factory       is to use         lambda       . Suppose you want to create a function to generate default values in a        defaultdict       . The function does some processing and returns a value, but you need to pass an argument for the function to work correctly. Here\u2019s an example:       In the above code, you create a function called       . The function takes an argument, does some processing, and returns the final result. Then, you create a        defaultdict       and use        lambda       to pass the string        'default value'       to       . When you try to get access to a missing key, the following steps are run:         The dictionary          def_dict        calls its         .default_factory        , which holds a reference to a         lambda        function.         The          lambda         function        gets called and returns the value that results from calling        with         'default value'        as an argument.       If you\u2019re working with        def_dict       and suddenly need to change the argument to       , then you can do something like this:       This time,       takes a new string argument (        'another default value'       ). From now on, if you try to access or modify a missing key, then you\u2019ll get a new default value, which is the string        'ANOTHER DEFAULT VALUE'       Finally, you can possibly face a situation where you need a default value that\u2019s different from        0       or       . In this case, you can also use        lambda       to        generate a different default value       . For example, suppose you have a        list       of integer numbers, and you need to calculate the cumulative product of each number. Then, you can use a        defaultdict       along with        lambda       as follows:       Here, you use        lambda       to supply a default value of        1       . With this initial value, you can calculate the cumulative product of each number in        lst       . Notice that you can\u2019t get the same result using        int       because the default value returned by        int       is always        0       , which is not a good initial value for the multiplication operations you need to perform here.       Using       is a function that returns a        partial       object. When you call this object with the positional arguments (        args       ) and keyword arguments (        keywords       ), it behaves similar to when you call       . You can take advantage of this behavior of       and use it to pass arguments to        .default_factory       in a Python        defaultdict       . Here\u2019s an example:       Here, you create a Python        defaultdict       and use       to supply an argument to        .default_factory       . Notice that you can also update        .default_factory       to use another argument for the callable       . This kind of behavior can add a lot of flexibility to your        defaultdict       objects.       Conclusion       The Python        defaultdict       type is a dictionary-like data structure provided by the Python standard library in a module called        collections       . The class inherits from        dict       , and its main added functionality is to supply default values for missing keys. In this tutorial, you\u2019ve learned how to use the Python        defaultdict       type for handling the missing keys in a dictionary.        You\u2019re now able to:         Create and use        a Python         defaultdict        to handle missing keys         Solve        real-world problems related to grouping, counting, and accumulating operations         Know        the implementation differences between         defaultdict        and         dict         Decide        when and why to use a Python         defaultdict        rather than a standard         dict       The Python        defaultdict       type is a convenient and efficient data structure that\u2019s designed to help you out when you\u2019re dealing with missing keys in a dictionary.

And           there it was!          I remember thinking that it would be as huge as hearthbleed (in terms of media coverage), but turns out I was wrong. We barely heard anything from vendors and the community until October. A few days ago, the recorded talk from Defcon was           released          and it grabbed my interest again. Enough so, that I wondered if my own stack was affected.         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he hf hg fu hh hi hj hk hl bl hm hn ho hp hq hr paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>          <figcaption class=\"ci ez ih ii ij cq co cp ik il cd dx\">           Credit: Maxime Deom         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"eb01\">          Let\u2019s back-off a bit and explain first what those attacks are. For that, we need a bit of HTTP 1.1 history. One problem with the original HTTP specification was that you needed to open a TCP connection for each new request made to the server. As we know, this can become an expensive process if the client requests a lot of resources. With HTTP 1.1, you can send multiple requests over the same TCP connection. This becomes potentially problematic when you introduce a proxy between the server and the clients. Consider the following simplified architecture:         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">             <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">             <noscript>         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"d047\">          Here, the connection between the ALB and the EC2 server will potentially be reused for different clients. That means that if a malicious client can leave some data in the receive buffer of the server, the next client will have his request modified. It turns out, it can be done by exploiting a combination of two headers: Content-Length and Transfer-Encoding. In a regular application, you will typically either specify a fixed Content-Length when you know the size of the payload or specify a chunked Transfer-Encoding when you don\u2019t (and you want to stream it piece by piece). But what if you send both?         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"58ad\">          The proxy might decide to use the Transfer-Encoding and the server, the Content-Length or vice versa. In any case, this will cause a desynchronization between the proxy and the server, hence the name of the attack. I won\u2019t go in more details, but you should definitely read the           original paper          and the           follow up blog post          by the original author to know all the details. I highly also suggest reading the blog post           HAProxy HTTP request smuggling          .         <h2 class=\"io ip ap ce cd iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb\" id=\"e2bf\">          What about Python?         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jc ea jd gn je gp jf gr jg gt cx\" id=\"b754\">          If you are reading this blog post, you probably already know that most of the Python code in production runs under the umbrella of a WSGI server. Those include uwsgi, apache (with mod_wsgi), waitress and gunicorn. My stack uses gunicorn, so the rest of the blog post will target this server, but you should verify if your server of choice is also vulnerable.            If you read this post and you are not on gunicorn &gt;19.10 or &gt;20.0.2, please stop reading and go upgrade!         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jt ea ju gn jv gp jw gr jx gt cx\" id=\"9d18\">          Going back to my story, when I watched the talk from Defcon, I immediately checked on gunicorn\u2019s Github to see if someone had opened an issue for this attack and\u2026           I found one          \ud83e\udd29. I got excited and started testing it for myself. I created           a basic application and infrastructure based on ECS          to conduct my tests. It has only one endpoint that returns the headers of the request in the body.         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>          <figcaption class=\"ci ez ih ii ij cq co cp ik il cd dx\">           Basic request and response of the application         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"6348\">          From there, the first step was to use the excellent Burp plugin           HTTP Request Smuggler          combined with the           plugin Flow          to test the application. This gave us a first baseline of potential vulnerabilities.         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>          <figcaption class=\"ci ez ih ii ij cq co cp ik il cd dx\">           Some attacks performed by the Request Smuggler plugin         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"b0d3\">          What you want to hunt for in this step are mostly 502, 404 and 405, luckily we got one. The other ones are not very useful, here is why:          <li class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt kc kd ke\" id=\"778a\">           200: Even if you sent multiple requests, they were all OK so both the proxy and server were in sync          <li class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy kf ea kg gn kh gp ki gr kj gt kc kd ke\" id=\"f0d4\">           400: The ALB blocked the request as invalid          <li class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy kf ea kg gn kh gp ki gr kj gt kc kd ke\" id=\"ff12\">           501: The ALB blocked a bad Transfer-Encoding as not implement         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"c229\">          The moral here is that the ALB is your ally, it blocks a LOT of stuff and it would have prevented even more attacks if I had simply enabled the setting:          . Some (not too security savvy) people complained on           twitter          when AWS rolled out this fix and unfortunately they decided to make it           disabled by default.          So make sure it\u2019s enabled in your infrastructure.         <h2 class=\"io ip ap ce cd iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb\" id=\"fdaf\">          Digging deeper         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jc ea jd gn je gp jf gr jg gt cx\" id=\"07c7\">          Now that we have an attack surface, let\u2019s try to dig a bit deeper. The attack we found is the following:         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"a7a2\">          Notice the space between the end of the TE (transfer-encoding) and the colon. The 405 means that the second time we sent the payload, the final X of the previous request was appended to the next request. This resulted in a method           XPOST          which does exist, hence the 405. But can we do better?         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"e3d5\">          In this attack, we completely override the next request. Even though the client did a POST, what he did for the server is a GET on /404. Ouch! This is bad \ud83d\ude1e. In both cases we exploited a CL-TE attack, because the proxy used the Content-Length while the server used the Transfer-Encoding. This is because even though           RFC 7230          states that           no whitespace is allowed between the header field-name and colon          , it used to be common for applications to normalize the name of headers.          <figcaption class=\"ci ez ih ii ij cq co cp ik il cd dx\">            Original file         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"cced\">          The fix was simply to remove the rstrip at line 6 (we actually made a setting so if you really need this behaviour, you can still operate, but you will be vulnerable). This is also the fix           golang decided to use          .         <h2 class=\"io ip ap ce cd iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb\" id=\"a672\">          And here I thought life was easy         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jc ea jd gn je gp jf gr jg gt cx\" id=\"43f2\">          As I was looking through the code for this first patch, I found an interesting bit of code that I thought could be exploited          <figcaption class=\"ci ez ih ii ij cq co cp ik il cd dx\">            Original file         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"2a9b\">          Here, we iterate over all headers and we set some values that will then be used to set the reader correctly. What is wrong with it you might ask? Well, what happens if you have a duplicate header? Only the last value is used and that might a cause a desync if your proxy uses the first value!         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"5b7c\">          So first, let\u2019s try to fix the Content-Length. I can\u2019t show you an exploit of this, because the ALB is already protecting us from this attack. Some proxies might not though, so that\u2019s why it\u2019s important that we fix it in gunicorn. According to           RFC 7230,          you can do two things in case of a duplicate CL:          <p class=\"gi gj ap kx gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"6a81\">           The recipient            MUST           either reject the message as invalid or replace the duplicated field-values with a single valid Content-Length field containing that decimal value prior to determining the message body length or forwarding the message.         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"0ebf\">          So the easy and safe fix is to reject the message.           Node servers          do that and that\u2019s also the new behavior of gunicorn.         <h2 class=\"io ip ap ce cd iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb\" id=\"6147\">          The particular case of Transfer-Encoding         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jc ea jd gn je gp jf gr jg gt cx\" id=\"aac6\">          TE is a weird header.           Reading more about it,          you discover that it\u2019s an           hop-by-hop          header. Meaning that each node can decide to change the TE along the route. You also learn that you can have multiple TE that you should handle in the given order. Looking back at the code, we are quite far from the spec!         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"bb09\">          In modern days, the most widely used TE is           chunked          (for large payloads that don\u2019t fit in one frame). Even if other TE exists (mainly           compress          ,           deflate          and           gzip          ), the ALB do not accept them and returns a 501. The only one that is also accepted is           identity,          it basically tells the server to do nothing with the payload (useless, I know \ud83d\ude02). But because of it, we can induce a TE-CL attack with a payload like:         <figure class=\"gz ha hb hc hd he co cp paragraph-image\">              <div class=\"hw hx s t u hy ai av hz ia\">              <noscript>         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"8977\">          This is because the second TE will override the           chunked          property in gunicorn which will then fallback on the CL to parse the body. The ALB seems to protect us from this attack by not forwarding the CL to the server, but it could potentially work with other proxies. To try to mitigate the attack, we might be tempted to just deny all TE except           chunked          and process the payload inside the WSGI server, but then we would break compatibility with existing applications and that\u2019s a big NO NO in Python. Further more, even though           PEP 3333          says:          <p class=\"gi gj ap kx gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"e958\">           WSGI servers            must           handle any supported inbound \u201chop-by-hop\u201d headers on their own, such as by decoding any inbound Transfer-Encoding, including chunked encoding if applicable.         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"985a\">          The reality is that an unofficial flag (           wsgi.input_terminated          ) exists to tell the WSGI server to transfer chunked data to the application (and vice-versa). This is all a big mess if you want my opinion and I am pretty sure that someone will find more desync attacks due to that feature. Simply because the WSGI server acts like another proxy layer in that scenario.         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"66e9\">          As for           RFC 7230,          it says the following:          <p class=\"gi gj ap kx gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"7528\">           If any transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a request payload body, the sender            MUST           apply chunked as the final transfer coding to ensure that the message is properly framed. If any transfer coding other than chunked is applied to a response payload body, the sender            MUST           either apply chunked as the final transfer coding or terminate the message by closing the connection.         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy gl ea gm gn go gp gq gr gs gt cx\" id=\"95dd\">          But if you look at the behaviour of ALB, it will accept the TE (in order):           chunked, identity.          Which is in theory not compliant. So for now, the new behaviour of gunicorn is that if any TE equals to           chunked          , it will consider the message as chunked even if it\u2019s not the last TE. If you are running behind an ALB, you will be protected. I cannot guaranty the same for other proxies.         <h2 class=\"io ip ap ce cd iq ir is it iu iv iw ix iy iz ja jb\" id=\"2128\">          Closing thoughts         <p class=\"gi gj ap ce gk b dy jc ea jd gn je gp jf gr jg gt cx\" id=\"c45a\">          Ouff, this has been a tough ride \ud83d\ude05!

The Twisted Requests (             treq            ) package is an HTTP client built on the popular             Twisted            library that is used for asynchronous requests. Async libraries offer the ability to do large amounts of network requests in parallel with relatively little CPU impact. This can be useful in HTTP clients that need to make several requests before they have all the information they need. In this article, we'll work through an example of making async calls to explore using treq.            Defining a problem to solve            I enjoy playing the real-time strategy game Clash Royale. While it is not open source, it does have a public API that we can use to show how async requests can come in handy.            Clash Royale is a mobile strategy player-vs-player game where players play cards in an arena to win. Each card has different strengths and weaknesses, and different players prefer different cards. Clash Royale remembers which card a player plays the most; this is their \"favorite\" card. Players come together in clans where they can help each other. Supercell, Clash Royale's developer, released an HTTP-based API where different statistics can be queried.

You can             register            an account to follow along with the tutorial, but you'll still be able to understand what we're building if you don't. If you do want to\u00a0register an account,\u00a0create an API token via the Clash Royale             developer portal            . Then choose \"Create New Key\" under your profile, and enter a name, description, and a valid IP address. (An exact address is required, so I used             this site            to find mine.) Since you should never save an API key in your code, keep it as a separate file in            :            Twisted programs            Running a program based on Twisted requires a number of additional packages to make the experience as smooth as possible. I will not cover all of them in this tutorial, but each one is worth exploring to learn more.            To make it easier to see what is going on, let's start with this\u00a0introductory program that prints             Hello world            , and then we'll talk through what it does:            This imports many more modules than we need for the \"Hello world\" example. We will need these modules for the final version of the program, which will accomplish the more complex task of asynchronously querying an API. After the import, the program reads the token from the file and stores it in the variable             token            . (We are not going to do anything with the token right now, but it's good to see that syntax.) Next there\u00a0is a             main            function that accepts a Twisted             reactor            . A reactor is sort of like an interface to the complex machinery of the Twisted package. In this case, the function             main            is sent as a parameter, and it's fed an additional argument.            The             main            returns a             defer.succeed(None)            . This is how it returns a value of the right type: a deferred value, but one that already has been \"fired\" or \"called.\" Because of that, the program will exit immediately after printing             Hello world            , as we need.            Next, we will look at the concepts of             async            functions and             ensureDeferred            :            In this program, which should start with the same imports, we moved all the logic to the async function             get_clan_details            . Just like a regular function, an             async            function has an implicit             return None            at the end. However, async functions, sometimes called co-routines, are a             different type            than             Deferred            . In order to let Twisted, which has existed since Python 1.5.2, use this modern feature, we must adapt the co-routine using             ensureDeferred            .            While we could write all the logic without using co-routines, using the             async            syntax will allow us to write code that is easier to understand, and we will need to move a lot less of the code into embedded callbacks.            The next concept to introduce is that of             await            . Later, we will             await            a network call, but for simplicity, right now, we will             await            on a timer. Twisted has a special function,             task.deferLater            , which will call a function with given parameters after some time has passed.            The following program will take five seconds to complete:            A note about types:             task.deferLater            returns a             Deferred            , as do most Twisted functions that do not have the value already available. When running the Twisted event loop, we can             await            on both             Deferred            values as well as co-routines.            The function             task.deferLater            will wait five seconds and then call our             lambda            , calculating the string to print out.            Now we have all the Twisted building blocks needed to write an efficient clan-analysis program!            Async calls with treq            Since we will be using the global reactor, we no longer need to accept the reactor as a parameter in the function that calculates these statistics:            The way to use the token is as a \"bearer\" token in the headers:            We want clan tags to be sent, which will be strings. Clan tags begin with             #            , so they must be quoted before they're put in URLs. This is because             #            has the special meaning \"URL fragment\":            The first step is to get the details of the clan, including the clan members:            Notice that we have to             await            the             treq.get            calls. We have to be explicit about when to wait and get information since it is an asynchronous network call. Just using the             await            syntax to call a             Deferred            function does             not            let us take full power of asynchronicity (we will see how to do it later).            Next, after getting the headers, we need to get the content. The treq library gives us a helper method that parses the JSON directly:            The content includes some metadata about the clan, which is not interesting for our current purposes, and a             memberList            field that contains the clan members. Note that while it has some data about the players, the current favorite card is not part of it. It does include the unique \"player tag\" that we can use to retrieve further data.            We collect all player tags, and, since they also begin with             #            , we URL-quote them:            Finally, we come to the real power of treq and Twisted: generating all requests for player data at once! That can really speed up tasks like this one, which queries an API over and over again. In cases of APIs with rate-limiting, this can be problematic.            There are times when we need to be considerate to our API owners and not run up against any rate limits. There are techniques to support rate-limiting explicitly in Twisted, but they are beyond the scope of this tutorial. (One important tool is             defer.DeferredSemaphore            An aside: await, Deferred, and callbacks            For those curious about the specifics of the returned object, here's a closer look at what's happening.            Remember that requests do not return the JSON body directly. Earlier, we used             await            so that we did not have to worry about exactly what the requests return. They actually return a             Deferred            . A             Deferred            can have an attached             callback            that will modify the Deferred. If the callback             returns            a Deferred, the final value of the Deferred will be the             value            of the returned Deferred.            So, to each deferred, we attach a callback that will retrieve the JSON of the body:            Attaching callbacks to Deferreds is a more manual technique, which makes code that is harder to follow but uses the async features more efficiently. Specifically, because we are attaching all the callbacks at the same time, we do not need to wait for the network calls, which potentially can take a long time, to indicate how to post-process the result.            From Deferreds to values            We cannot calculate the most popular favorite cards until all results have been gathered. We have a list of Deferreds, but what we want is a Deferred             that gets a list value            . This inversion is exactly what the Twisted function             defer.gatherResults            does:            This seemingly innocent call is where we use the full power of Twisted. The             defer.gatherResults            function immediately returns a deferred that will             fire            only when all the constituent Deferreds have fired and will fire with the result. It even gives us free error-handling: if any of the Deferreds error out, it will immediately return a failed deferred, which will cause the             await            to raise an exception.            Now that we have all the players' details, we need to munch some data. We get to use one of Python's coolest built-ins,             collections.Counter            . This class takes a list of things and counts how many times it has seen each thing, which is exactly what we need for vote counting or popularity contests:            Finally, we print it:            Putting it all together            So, putting it all together, we have:            Thanks to the efficiency and expressive syntax of Twisted and treq, this is all the code we need to make asynchronous calls to an API. And if you were wondering about the outcome, my clan's list of favorite cards is Wizard, Mega Knight, Valkyrie, and Royal Giant, in descending order.

The idea behind itertools is to deal with large amounts of data (typically sequence data sets) in a memory efficient way.According to the docs [           1          This module implements a number of iterator building blocks inspired by constructs from APL, Haskell, and SML.Each has been recast in a form suitable for Python.          The module standardizes a core set of fast, memory efficient tools that are useful by themselves or in combination.Together, they form an \u201citerator algebra\u201d making it possible to construct specialized tools succinctly and efficiently in pure Python.         All functions included in the itertools module construct and produce iterators.Iterators are implementations of the iterator protocol meaning that large data sets can be consumed \u201clazily\u201d.In other words, the whole data set does not need to be in memory at once during processing.Instead, each element is consumed and processed separately.This eliminates common side effects of large data sets (such as swapping) leading to improved performance.If you want to know more about iterators, I can highly recommend two articles from Trey Hunner (see [           2           3         The goal of this article is to show you the functions available in the itertools module as well as presenting possible use cases.The code snippets used in this article can be found on          GitHub         Table of Contents            Why do we need itertools?            Table of Contents            What does the module cover?              Infinite iterators              Iterators terminating on the shortest input sequence              Combinatoric iterators            More itertools            Summary            References         What does the module cover?         The functions in the itertools module can be put into three groups:          Infinite iterators          Iterators terminating on the shortest input sequence          Combinatoric iterators         Infinite iterators         Infinite iterators produce streams of infinite length (as the name suggests).Accessing them by functions or loops to truncate the streams is strongly recommended.There exist three of them in the itertools module:         , and         The purpose of         is to return an iterator, that simply starts counting at a specified number.Optionally, you can provide the step size as a second parameter.012341012141618         The         function really shines in combination with other functions.Let\u2019s assume you have a list of names and you want to index them.This may look like this:from itertools import count           Note:          is a built-in function returning an iterator of tuples, where the i-th tuple contains the i-th element from each of the argument sequences or iterables:         iterates over all elements of an iterable, saves a copy and returns them.Once the iterable is exhausted, it continues infinitely returning the saved elements.To understand the function better, consider the following use case: You are teaching a class and for a group work, you want to divide the students into three teams.The following code snippet shows you a possible implementation of it usingfrom itertools import cycle         The          repeat         function receives an object as parameter and returns it over and over again.Optionally, you can specify the number of repetitions as a second argument. Otherwise, it repeats forever.         is commonly used together with the built-in         and         functions.The following example is from the itertools documentation [           1It computes the square numbers for the numbers 0-9.         Iterators terminating on the shortest input sequence         As the name suggests, the functions provided in this section are terminating on the shortest input sequence.In contrast to infinite iterators, these functions do not produce infinite data streams.This group is by far the largest as it contains 12 functions:           accumulate()           compress()           dropwhile()           filterfalse()           takewhile()         The function          accumulate()         allows you to accumulate results of binary operations.By default, it uses the         function.from itertools import accumulatefrom operator import mul         In the example at hand we have a list          numbers         containing the numbers 1 to 5.          result1         gets an iterator assigned returning the previous sum plus the next element until it is exhausted.The iterator assigned to          result2         uses         to accumulate the elements instead ofFurthermore, the iterator assigned to          result3         got an          initial         parameter specified. This parameter will be added at the beginning of the list and hence included in all calculations.In order to print the results, we need to consume the iterators by turning them into lists using the built-in         function.         Sometimes, it is necessary to consume multiple iterators and/or iterables sequentially.Instead of using multiple for-loops, you can utilizefrom itertools import chain         If you want to pass an iterable of iterators/iterables, you can use the alternate constructorThe example above would change as follows:         The next function we will cover isIn essence, it receives two parameters:          data         is an iterable you want to compress and          selectors         is an iterable, which tells you whether the element in          data         is kept or dismissed.from itertools import compress    for name in names:        else:    return name_selectors         In this example,  we define a custom selection function, which receives a list of names and checks whether a name starts with an          A          1         (basically          True         ) is mapped, otherwise a          0This leads to an iterator only returning names starting with an          A         The idea behind the          dropwhile()         function is to drop elements as long as the specified condition is true.If the condition once becomes false, all remaining elements are returned sequentially.          takewhile()         is the direct opposite of          dropwhile()         and returns the elements as long as the predicate is true.         The next function we are going to investigate is          filterfalse()Basically, it is the complement for the built-in         function.Instead of returning the element if the specified function returns true for it, it only returns elements in case the function returns false.from itertools import filterfalse    return number &lt; 0         The next function we will look at isLet\u2019s assume you have a list of data points, which consist of a group and a value.To make things easy, a data point is a tuple of the form         , where both are simply integers.Then we can group them as follows:from itertools import groupbyfrom operator import itemgetter         will return an iterator yielding the group/key and the corresponding values as a list.We specified the key as a second argument.In our case, we utilize          operator.itemgetter         and pass the first element of the data point as key/group.However, if we run the code snippet at hand, we get the following:         You might have expected only three results with the keys 0, 1, and 2 and their corresponding value lists.However, this requires an additional preparing step.         looks at the first element and appends it to the value list of the newly created group (with the key of the first item).If the second element\u2019s  key is equal to the previously used group/key, it is appended.In case it is not the same,  a new group based on the element\u2019s key is created, where the element is appended to (and so on).To get three groups (as you might have expected), we need to sort our data points before grouping them.Therefore, let\u2019s add the following line before the for-loop:         Running the script again prints the desired result.         is a function only returning selected items from a given iterable.You can think of it as a function for iterators, which basically does the very same thing as the slice-operator         does for lists and tuples.         takes four parameters:          iterable          start          stop         , and          stepThe last three are equivalent to the three you can specify for the slice-operator for lists and tuples.from itertools import islice           Note:          Again, we used the built-in          function to consume the whole iterator and turn it into a list.         The         function returns an iterator that executes a given function using arguments obtained from a given iterable.It is pretty similar to the built-in         function.However, instead of constructing a tuple from multiple iterators, it splits up the items in a single iterator as arguments to the mapping function using the * syntax.from itertools import starmap         In the example at hand, we first define a simple function, which computes the power for a given base and exponent.Instead of only returning the result, it returns a tuple of the formWe consume the iterator returned by         with a for-loop and print each element in an user-friendly way.         The         function takes an iterable and returns independent iterators based on it.The default number of returned iterators is 2, but it can be specified as the function\u2019s second argument.It is important to note, that the original iterable should not be used/consumed afterwards.This may lead to unexpected behavior.from itertools import islicefrom itertools import tee           Note:          Iterators returned by          are           not          threadsafe.According to the docs: \u201cA RuntimeError may be raised when using simultaneously iterators returned by the same          call, even if the original iterable is threadsafe.\u201d         Last but not least we have a look at the         function.If you use the built-in         function to combine two iterables, it will stop if one of both is exhausted.If you want to continue until the longer iterable is exhausted, you can utilize         as it will fill missing values with the specified          fillvalue         (default is          Nonefrom itertools import zip_longest         Combinatoric iterators         The group of combinatoric iterators consists of the following four functions:           permutations()           combinations()           combinations_with_replacement()         The         function computes the cartesian product for a given list of iterables.Thus, it is the equivalent of using nested for-loops.It is also worth to note that nested loops cycle like an odometer with the rightmost element advancing on every iteration, which creates a lexicographic ordering.Granted a sorted input, that means the product tuples are emitted in sorted order.I found a pretty nice example on Doug Hellmann\u2019s PyMOTW-3 blog [           4         ], which is shown below:from itertools import chainfrom itertools import product    product(        SUITS,for card in DECK:         It computes all cards of a standard deck by just specifying the face cards and the suits. 2H  2D  2C  2S 3H  3D  3C  3S 4H  4D  4C  4S 5H  5D  5C  5S 6H  6D  6C  6S 7H  7D  7C  7S 8H  8D  8C  8S 9H  9D  9C  9S10H 10D 10C 10S JH  JD  JC  JS QH  QD  QC  QS KH  KD  KC  KS AH  AD  AC  AS         The          permutations()         function generates all possible permutations for a given length          rIf          r         is not specified, the length of each permutation is equal to the length of the iterable specified as the first argument.from itertools import permutations         In contrast to          permutations()         , the          combinations()         function requires the          r         argument.Furthermore, elements are treated as unique based on their position, not on their value.So only if the input elements\u2019 values are unique, there will be no repeated values in each combination.from itertools import combinations         Unlike          combinations()         , the          combinations_with_replacement()         function          does         compute combinations which include repeated elements.from itertools import combinations_with_replacement         More itertools         In order to extend the existing itertools tool set, you can install          more-itertools           5         ] providing high performance functions built upon the existing ones.The package is available via          pip         Now, you can use functions likefrom more_itertools import flatten         Summary         To sum up, we got to know all currently existing functions of the itertools module.We had a look at possible use cases and (if possible) connected them to common real world scenarios.I hope you enjoyed reading the article.Let me know what you think about it via          Twitter         and feel free to share it with others.Stay curious and keep coding!

Tortoise ORM was build with relations in mind and admiration for the excellent and popular Django ORM.It's engraved in it's design that you are working not with just tables, you work with relational data.           You can find docs at            ReadTheDocs            Note            Tortoise ORM is young project and breaking changes are to be expected.We keep a             Changelog            and it will have possible breakage clearly documented.           Tortoise ORM is supported on CPython &gt;= 3.7 for SQLite, MySQL and PostgreSQL.           Why was Tortoise ORM built?           Python has many existing and mature ORMs, unfortunately they are designed with an opposing paradigm of how I/O gets processed.            asyncio           is relatively new technology that has a very different concurrency model, and the largest change is regarding how I/O is handled.           However, Tortoise ORM is not first attempt of building            asyncio           ORM, there are many cases of developers attempting to map synchronous python ORMs to the async world, initial attempts did not have a clean API.           Hence we started Tortoise ORM.           Tortoise ORM is designed to be functional, yet familiar, to ease the migration of developers wishing to switch to            asyncio           .           It also performs well when compared to other Python ORMs, trading places with Pony ORM:           How is an ORM useful?           When you build an application or service that uses a relational database, there is a point when you can't just get away with just using parameterized queries or even query builder, you just keep repeating yourself, writing slightly different code for each entity.Code has no idea about relations between data, so you end up concatenating your data almost manually.It is also easy to make a mistake in how you access your database, making it easy for SQL-injection attacks to occur.Your data rules are also distributed, increasing the complexity of managing your data, and even worse, is applied inconsistently.           An ORM (Object Relational Mapper) is designed to address these issues, by centralising your data model and data rules, ensuring that your data is managed safely (providing immunity to SQL-injection) and keeps track of relationships so you don't have to.           Getting Started           Installation           First you have to install tortoise like this:           Then you should install your db driver           <pre>pip install asyncpg aiosqlite aiomysql</pre>           Quick Tutorial           Primary entity of tortoise is            tortoise.models.Model           .You can start writing models like this:           After you defined all your models, tortoise needs you to init them, in order to create backward relations between models and match your db client with appropriate models.           You can do it like this:           Here we create connection to SQLite database in the local directory called            db.sqlite3           , and then we discover &amp; initialise models.           Tortoise ORM currently supports the following databases:            SQLite (requires             aiosqlite            )            PostgreSQL (requires             asyncpg            )            MySQL (requires             aiomysql            )            generate_schema           generates the schema on an empty database. Tortoise generates schemas in safe mode by default whichincludes the            IF NOT EXISTS           clause, so you may include it in your main code.           After that you can start using your models:           Contributing           Please have a look at the            Contribution Guide           License           This project is licensed under the Apache License - see the            LICENSE.txt           file for details      \u00a9 2020 GitHub, Inc.

It\u2019s a Python library (named            my           ), a collection of modules for:            social networks: posts, comments, favorites            reading: e-books and pdfs            annotations: highlights and comments            todos and notes            health data: sleep, exercise, weight, heart rate, and other body metrics            location            photos &amp; videos            browser history            instant messaging           The package hides the            gory details           of locating data, parsing, error handling and caching.  You simply \u2018import\u2019 your data and get to work with familiar Python types and data structures.            Here\u2019s a short example to give you an idea: \u201cwhich subreddits I find the most interesting?\u201d              orgmode              62              emacs              60              selfhosted              51              QuantifiedSelf              46           I consider my digital trace an important part of my identity. (            #extendedmind           )  The fact that the data is siloed, and accessing it is inconvenient and borderline frustrating feels very wrong.           Once the data is available as Python objects, I can easily plug it into existing tools, libraries and frameworks.  It makes building new tools considerably easier and allows creating new ways of interacting with the data.           I tried different things over the years and I think I\u2019m getting to the point where other people can also benefit from my code by \u2018just\u2019 plugging in their data,  and that\u2019s why I\u2019m sharing this.           Imagine if all your life was reflected digitally and available at your fingertips.  This library is my attempt to achieve this vision.           If you\u2019re in a hurry, feel free to jump straight to the            demos           .           For            installation/configuration/development guide           , see            SETUP.org           .           Table of contents:            Why?            How does a Python package help?              Why don\u2019t you just put everything in a massive database?            What\u2019s inside?            How do you use it?            Ad-hoc and interactive              What were my music listening stats for 2018?              What are the most interesting Slate Star Codex posts I\u2019ve read?              Accessing exercise data              Book reading progress              Messenger stats            How does it get input data?            Q &amp; A              Why Python?              Can anyone use it?              How easy is it to use?              What about privacy?              But               should              I use it?              Would it suit               me              ?              What it isn\u2019t?            Related links            \u2013           Why?           The main reason that led me to develop this is the dissatisfaction of the current situation:            Our personal data is siloed and trapped across cloud services and various devices             Even when it\u2019s possible to access it via the API, it\u2019s hardly useful, unless you\u2019re an experienced programmer, willing to invest your time and infrastructure.            We have insane amounts of data scattered across the cloud, yet we\u2019re left at the mercy of those who collect it to provide something useful based on it             Integrations of data across silo boundaries are almost non-existent. There is so much potential and it\u2019s all wasted.            I\u2019m not willing to wait till some vaporwave project reinvents the whole computing model from scratch             As a programmer, I am in capacity to do something              right now             , even though it\u2019s not necessarily perfect and consistent.           I\u2019ve written a lot about it            here           , so allow me to simply quote:          <blockquote>             search and information access               Why can\u2019t I search over all of my personal chat history with a friend, whether it\u2019s ICQ logs from 2005 or Whatsapp logs from 2019?               Why can\u2019t I have incremental search over my tweets? Or browser bookmarks? Or over everything I\u2019ve ever typed/read on the Internet?               Why can\u2019t I search across my watched youtube videos, even though most of them have subtitles hence allowing for full text search?               Why can\u2019t I see the places my friends recommended me on Google maps (or any other maps app)?             productivity               Why can\u2019t my Google Home add shopping list items to Google Keep? Let alone other todo-list apps.               Why can\u2019t I create a task in my todo list or calendar from a conversation on Facebook Messenger/Whatsapp/VK.com/Telegram?             journaling and history               Why do I have to lose all my browser history if I decide to switch browsers?               Why can\u2019t I see all the places I traveled to on a single map and photos alongside?               Why can\u2019t I see what my heart rate (i.e. excitement) and speed were side by side with the video I recorded on GoPro while skiing?               Why can\u2019t I easily transfer all my books and metadata if I decide to switch from Kindle to PocketBook or vice versa?             consuming digital content               Why can\u2019t I see stuff I highlighted on Instapaper as an overlay on top of web page?               Why can\u2019t I have single \u2018read it later\u2019 list, unifying all things saved on Reddit/Hackernews/Pocket?               Why can\u2019t I use my todo app instead of \u2018Watch later\u2019 playlist on youtube?               Why can\u2019t I \u2018follow\u2019 some user on Hackernews?               Why can\u2019t I see if I\u2019ve run across a Youtube video because my friend sent me a link months ago?               Why can\u2019t I have uniform music listening stats based on my Last.fm/iTunes/Bandcamp/Spotify/Youtube?               Why am I forced to use Spotify\u2019s music recommendation algorithm and don\u2019t have an option to try something else?               Why can\u2019t I easily see what were the books/music/art recommended by my friends or some specific Twitter/Reddit/Hackernews users?               Why my otherwise perfect hackernews                app for Android               doesn\u2019t share saved posts/comments with the website?             health and body maintenance               Why can\u2019t I tell if I was more sedentary than usual during the past week and whether I need to compensate by doing a bit more exercise?               Why can\u2019t I see what\u2019s the impact of aerobic exercise on my resting HR?               Why can\u2019t I have a dashboard for all of my health: food, exercise and sleep to see baselines and trends?               Why can\u2019t I see the impact of temperature or CO2 concentration in room on my sleep?               Why can\u2019t I see how holidays (as in, not going to work) impact my stress levels?               Why can\u2019t I take my Headspace app data and see how/if meditation impacts my sleep?               Why can\u2019t I run a short snippet of code and check some random health advice on the Internet against                my               health data.             personal finance               Why am I forced to manually copy transactions from different banking apps into a spreadsheet?               Why can\u2019t I easily match my Amazon/Ebay orders with my bank transactions?             why I can\u2019t do anything when I\u2019m offline or have a wonky connection?             tools for thinking and learning               Why when something like                \u2018mind palace\u2019               is                literally possible               with VR technology, we don\u2019t see any in use?               Why can\u2019t I easily convert select Instapaper highlights or new foreign words I encountered on my Kindle into Anki flashcards?             mediocre interfaces               Why do I have to suffer from poor management and design decisions in UI changes, even if the interface is not the main reason I\u2019m using the product?               Why can\u2019t I leave priorities and notes on my saved Reddit/Hackernews items?               Why can\u2019t I leave private notes on Deliveroo restaurants/dishes, so I\u2019d remember what to order/not to order next time?               Why do people have to suffer from Google Inbox shutdown?             communication and collaboration               Why can\u2019t I easily share my web or book highlights with a friend? Or just make highlights in select books public?               Why can\u2019t I easily find out other person\u2019s expertise without interrogating them, just by looking what they read instead?             backups               Why do I have to think about it and actively invest time and effort?            I\u2019m tired of having to use multiple different messengers and social networks            I\u2019m tired of shitty bloated interfaces             Why do we have to be at mercy of their developers, designers and product managers? If we had our data at hand, we could fine-tune interfaces for our needs.            I\u2019m tired of mediocre search experience             Text search is something computers do              exceptionally             well.      Yet, often it\u2019s not available offline, it\u2019s not incremental, everyone reinvents their own query language, and so on.            I\u2019m frustrated by poor information exploring and processing experience             While for many people, services like Reddit or Twitter are simply time killers (and I don\u2019t judge), some want to use them efficiently, as a source of information/research.      Modern bookmarking experience makes it far from perfect.           You can dismiss this as a list of first-world problems, and you would be right, they are.  But the major reason I want to solve these problems is to be better at learning and working with knowledge,  so I could be better at solving the real problems.           How does a Python package help?           When I started solving some of these problems for myself, I\u2019ve noticed a common pattern: the            hardest bit           is actually getting your data in the first place.  It\u2019s inherently error-prone and frustrating.           But once you have the data in a convenient representation, working with it is pleasant \u2013 you get to explore and build instead of fighting with yet another stupid REST API.           This python package knows how to find data, deserialize it and normalize it to the convenient representation.  You have the full power of the programming language to transform the data and do whatever comes to your mind.           Why don\u2019t you just put everything in a massive database?           Glad you\u2019ve asked! I wrote a whole            post           about it.           In short: while databases are efficient and easy to read from, often they aren\u2019t flexible enough to fit your data.  You\u2019re probably going to end up writing code anyway.           While working with your data, you\u2019ll inevitably notice common patterns and code repetition, which you\u2019ll probably want to extract somewhere.  That\u2019s where a Python package comes in.           What\u2019s inside?           Here\u2019s an (incomplete) list of the modules in the public package:               my.bluemaestro               Bluemaestro              temperature/humidity/pressure monitor               my.body.blood              Blood tracking               my.body.weight              Weight data (manually logged)               my.books.kobo              Kobo e-ink reader: annotations and reading stats               my.calendar.holidays              Provides data on days off work (based on public holidays + manual inputs)               my.coding.commits              Git commits data: crawls filesystem               my.coding.github              Github events and their metadata: comments/issues/pull requests               my.emfit               Emfit QS              sleep tracker               my.fbmessenger              Module for Facebook Messenger messages               my.feedbin              Module for Feedbin RSS reader               my.feedly              Module for Feedly RSS reader               my.hypothesis              Hypothes.is highlights and annotations               my.instapaper              Instapaper bookmarks, highlights and annotations               my.location.takeout              Module for Google Takeout data               my.materialistic              Module for               Materialistic              app for Hackernews               my.notes.orgmode              Programmatic access and queries to org-mode files on the filesystem               my.photos              Module for accessing photos and videos, with their GPS and timestamps               my.pinboard              Module for pinboard.in bookmarks               my.reading.polar              Module for Polar articles and highlights               my.reddit              Module for Reddit data: saved items/comments/upvotes etc               my.rtm               Remember The Milk              tasks and notes               my.smscalls              Phone calls and SMS messages               my.twitter              Module for Twitter (uses official twitter archive export)           Some modules are private, and need a bit of cleanup before merging:              my.workouts              Exercise activity, from Endomondo and manual logs              my.sleep.manual              Subjective sleep data, manually logged              my.nutrition              Food and drink consumption data, logged manually from different sources              my.money              Expenses and shopping data              my.webhistory              Browsing history (part of               promnesia              )             How do you use it?             Mainly I use it as a data provider for my scripts, tools, and dashboards.             Also, check out              my infrastructure map             .  It\u2019s a draft at the moment, but it might be helpful for understanding what\u2019s my vision on HPI.             Instant search             Typical search interfaces make me unhappy as they are              siloed, slow, awkward to use and don\u2019t work offline             .  So I built my own ways around it! I write about it in detail              here             .             In essence, I\u2019m mirroring most of my online data like chat logs, comments, etc., as plaintext.  I can overview it in any text editor, and incrementally search over              all of it             in a single keypress.             orger              orger             is a tool and set of modules for accessing data via org-mode.  It allows searching and overviewing, and in addition, I\u2019m using it for creating tasks straight from native app interfaces (e.g. Reddit/Telegram) and spaced repetition via              org-drill             .             I write about it in detail              here             and              here             .             promnesia              promnesia             is a browser extension I\u2019m working on to escape silos by              unifying annotations and browsing history             from different data sources.             I\u2019ve been using it for more than a year now and working on final touches to properly release it for other people.             dashboard             As a big fan of              #quantified-self             , I\u2019m working on personal health, sleep and exercise dashboard, built from various data sources.             I\u2019m working on making it public, you can see some screenshots              here             .             timeline             Timeline is a              #lifelogging             project I\u2019m working on.             I want to see all my digital history, search in it, filter, easily jump at a specific point in time and see the context when it happened.  That way it works as a sort of external memory.             Ideally, it would look similar to Andrew Louis\u2019s              Memex             , or might even reuse his interface if  he open sources it. I highly recommend watching his talk for inspiration.             Ad-hoc and interactive             What were my music listening stats for 2018?

With few lines of Python I can quickly recommend them posts I engaged most with, i.e. the ones I annotated most on              Hypothesis             .                32                17                16                16                12                11                11                10                9                9             Accessing exercise data             E.g. see use of              my.workouts              here             .

If you\u2019re curious about any specific data sources I\u2019m using, I\u2019ve written it up              in detail             .             In short:              The data is               periodically synchronized              from the services (cloud or not) locally, on the filesystem               As a result, you get                JSONs/sqlite               (or other formats, depending on the service) on your disk.               Once you have it, it\u2019s trivial to back it up and synchronize to other computers/phones, if necessary.               To schedule periodic sync, I\u2019m using                cron               .               my.              package only accesses the data on the filesystem               That makes it extremely fast, reliable, and fully offline capable.             As you can see, in such a setup, the data is lagging behind the \u2018realtime\u2019.  I consider it a necessary sacrifice to make everything fast and resilient.             In theory, it\u2019s possible to make the system almost realtime by having a service that sucks in data continuously (rather than periodically), but it\u2019s harder as well.             Q &amp; A             Why Python?             I don\u2019t consider Python unique as a language suitable for such a project.  It just happens to be the one I\u2019m most comfortable with.  I do have some reasons that I think make it              specifically             good, but explaining them is out of this post\u2019s scope.             In addition, Python offers a              very rich ecosystem             for data analysis, which we can use to our benefit.             That said, I\u2019ve never seen anything similar in other programming languages, and I would be really interested in, so please send me links if you know some.  I\u2019ve heard LISPs are great for data? ;)             Overall, I wish              FFIs             were a bit more mature, so we didn\u2019t have to think about specific programming languages at all.             Can anyone use it?             Yes!              you can plug in your own data              most modules are isolated, so you can only use the ones that you want to              everything is easily extensible               Starting from simply adding new modules to any dynamic hackery you can possibly imagine within Python.             How easy is it to use?             The whole setup requires some basic programmer literacy:              installing/running and potentially modifying Python code              using symlinks              potentially running Cron jobs             If you have any ideas on making the setup simpler, please let me know!             What about privacy?             The modules contain no data, only code to operate on the data.             Everything is              local fist             , the input data is on your filesystem.  If you\u2019re truly paranoid, you can even wrap it in a Docker container.             There is still a question of whether you trust yourself at even keeping all the data on your disk, but it is out of the scope of this post.             If you\u2019d rather keep some code private too, it\u2019s also trivial to achieve with a private subpackage.             But              should             I use it?            <blockquote>              Sure, maybe you can achieve a perfect system where you can instantly find and recall anything that you\u2019ve done. Do you really want it?    Wouldn\u2019t that, like, make you less human?             I\u2019m not a gatekeeper of what it means to be human, but I don\u2019t think that the shortcomings of the human brain are what makes us such.             So I can\u2019t answer that for you. I certainly want it though.  I\u2019m              quite open             about my goals \u2013 I\u2019d happily get merged/augmented with a computer to enhance my thinking and analytical abilities.             While at the moment              we don\u2019t even remotely understand             what would such merging or \u201cmind uploading\u201d entail exactly,  I can clearly delegate some tasks, like long term memory, information lookup, and data processing to a computer. They can already handle it really well.            <blockquote>              What about these people who have perfect recall and wish they hadn\u2019t.             Sure, maybe it sucks. At the moment though, I don\u2019t anything close to it and this only annoys me.  I want to have a choice at least, and digital tools give me this choice.             Would it suit              me             ?             Probably, at least to some extent.             First, our lives are different, so our APIs might be different too.  This is more of a demonstration of what\u2019s I\u2019m using, although I did spend effort towards making it as modular and extensible as possible, so other people could use it too.  It\u2019s easy to modify code, add extra methods and modules. You can even keep all your modifications private.             But after all, we\u2019ve all sharing many similar activities and using the same products, so there is a huge overlap.  I\u2019m not sure how far we can stretch it and keep modules generic enough to be used by multiple people. But let\u2019s give it a try perhaps? :)             Second, interacting with your data through the code is the central idea of the project.  That kind of cuts off people without technical skills, and even many people capable of coding,  who dislike the idea of writing code outside of work.             It might be possible to expose some              no-code             interfaces,  but I still feel that wouldn\u2019t be enough.             I\u2019m not sure whether it\u2019s a solvable problem at this point, but happy to hear any suggestions!             What it isn\u2019t?              It\u2019s not vaporwave               The project is a little crude, but it\u2019s real and working. I\u2019ve been using it for a long time now, and find it fairly sustainable to keep using for the foreseeable future.              It\u2019s not going to be another silo               While I don\u2019t have anything against commercial use (and I believe any work in this area will benefit all of us), I\u2019m not planning to build a product out of it.               I really hope it can grow into or inspire some mature open source system.               Please take my ideas and code and build something cool from it!

It is usually an order of magnitude faster than theinterval tree both for building and query lookups.           The implementation here is a revived version of the one used in the now defunctPyGr library, which died of bitrot. I have made it less memory-consuming andcreated wrapper functions which allows batch-querying the NCLS for further speed           It was implemented to be the cornerstone of the PyRanges project, but I have madeit available to the Python community as a stand-alone library.

Abstract:            Partial failures occur frequently in cloud systems and can cause serious damage including inconsistency and data loss. Unfortunately, these failures are not well understood. Nor can they be effectively detected. In this paper, we first study 100 real-world partial failures from five mature systems to understand their characteristics. We find that these failures are caused by a variety of defects that require the unique conditions of the production environment to be triggered. Manually writing effective detectors to systematically detect such failures is both time-consuming and error-prone. We thus propose OmegaGen, a static analysis tool that automatically generates customized watchdogs for a given program by using a novel program reduction technique. We have successfully applied OmegaGen to six large distributed systems. In evaluating 22 real-world partial failure cases in these systems, the generated watchdogs can detect 20 cases with a median detection time of 4.2 seconds, and pinpoint the failure scope for 18 cases. The generated watchdogs also expose an unknown, confirmed partial failure bug in the latest version of ZooKeeper.

somewhere deep in your stack, run      %debug      post-mortem debugger      drop you in an interpreter right where the error happened     . You can inspect all the variables, go up and down the stack, and figure out what happened.     That should be enough to rock the world of some readers, but there's more! The problem with pdb is it's a very limited interpreter, lacking such luxuries as tab completion. What about if the bug requires something more powerful? Well my friend, do I have a snippet for you:      extract     is the single most useful function I've written in five years of working in Python. It grabs the caller's environment, finds your interpreter session in the stack, and      stuffs the caller's env into that session     . Here it is working in isolation:     See? It's magic enough just by itself. But in combination with      %debug      more magic     A Daft Example     The killer feature is when you've got some piece of numerical analysis that fails      occasionally     . Debugging things that fail occassionally is misery since if you knew what circumstances caused the bug, you'd probably already have fixed it. Post-mortem debugging is a lifesaver in this case, since it lets you wait for the circumstances that cause the bug to turn up naturally.     Consider this snippet,     which generates the distribution of times at which a random walk becomes positive. Most of the time it runs fine, but occasionally it throws an      IndexError     What on earth? I call      %debug     and get the usual prompt     13     return np.array(idxs)     14      and type      p xs     to see if there's something obviously wrong.      It doesn't look like anything to me     Just a bunch of numbers. Hrm. Ok, in I type     , and quit the debugger. Back in my Jupyter session,      xs     has - magically! - appeared in my workspace, and a quick      ...shows that sometimes the random walk never becomes positive.     D'oh. Never becomes positive means an empty array of positive indices, meaning     is out of bounds.     That's an artificial, facile, ridiculous example which - on purportedly less random data - happens to me three times a week. Once upon a time I'd have to commit actual thought to figuring out what scenario was leading to an out of bounds. With the help of      pdb     and      extract     , I can instead program thought-free!     Other tricks       You can also invoke the post mortem debugger with       rather than going through the        %debug       magic.       You don't have to invoke        extract       from the base of the stack. You can go up a few levels first, if you think the error's cause is in a different place from where it's discovered.        Learning the debugger commands is absolutely worth it       You don't have to wait for an error either. You can drop       - an alias for       - in your code anywhere to get to the debugger, or you can simply call        extract       directly.       If I'm chasing some numerical issue, I'll often set up        if       statements that trigger        extract       when values get particularly large or small.       I have        extract       and some other utilities bundled up in a personal tools package that I call         aljpy       . When I find myself somewhere new, I install it using       and then call extract with       . I wouldn't recommend using my tools package since I'll change it on a whim, but I do recommend building your own.       Incidentally, the code above is not version I use. I've also nailed on support for grabbing the locals of arbitrary functions and modules. It also throws an error on exit, which drops me directly back to my session where my new locals are waiting.     icons by dave gandy    , theme by     #6d2e98", "https://pycoders.com/link/3716/c9pvtwdh8p": "   How to use Jupyter Notebooks in 2020 (Part 1: The data science landscape)  <meta content=\"Love it or hate it, they're here to stay.

Here, I\u2019ll talk about the data science landscape, and the forces that pushesour tools to evolve.        Ah, Jupyter Notebooks.       Love it or hate it, they\u2019re here to stay. The lasttime I wrote about them was two years ago (it\u2019s about        running a notebookfrom a remoteserverand the ecosystem has grown ever since\u2014even how I interact with notebookstotally changed!       In this multi-part blogpost, I\u2019d review my oft-used tool in the data sciencetoolbox, Jupyter Notebooks, and how I use them in modern times. I dividedthis post into three:         Part I: The data science landscape        . I\u2019d like to look into how the  practice of data science has changed for the past few years. Then, I\u2019ll  zoom into the three main forces that changed the way I use Notebooks today.          Part II: How I use Notebooks in 2020        . Given these  changes, new tools in the Notebook ecosystem emerged. I\u2019d like to share  what I like (and don\u2019t like) about them, and how I use them in my          Part III: Notebooks and the future        . Here I\u2019ll share my  wishlist for Notebooks, potential gaps that the community can still  fill-in, and why Notebooks are still awesome!       To give context, a little more        aboutme       : as a data scientist, I alternatebetween doing analyses on notebooks and writing production code for dataproducts. My work environment is highly-collaborative so I don\u2019t just reviewcode, I also read (and attempt to reproduce) others\u2019 notebook analyses. Withthat said, I have a strong bias to production code and softwarebest practices, yet I still use notebooks in my day-to-day.       The data science landscape today       The field of data science is        rapidly changing       .  We\u2019venow entered a time where phrases like        \u201csexiest job of the 21stcentury\u201d       and        \u201cdata is the newoil\u201d       have become old and replaced by more realistic business problems and groundedtechnical challenges. I see this change as two-fold: we now need to supportboth the (1) demand for productionizing analyses and experiments, and the (2)rapid adoption of the Cloud.        Figure       : A simplified framework on how to think about the advancements in       the data science process for the past years       First,        the need for production       , i.e., creation of data products ordeploying experiment artifacts within the software engineering lifecycle, hasgrown through the years. This is evidenced by an uptake for moreengineering type of work with the rise of        machine learning engineers and datascience softwaredevelopersFurthermore, analyses aren\u2019t confined anymore insidepublications or charts, for there is now a growing demand for experiments to bereproduced and its artifacts to be deployed.       Next, the exponential increase of data necessitates the        adoption of the Cloud       .  We cannot just load a 1TB dataset in pandas usingour own laptops! The popularity of tools like Docker and Kubernetesallowed us to scale our data-processing workloads at unprecedented levels.Cloud adoption means that we take care of scaling, resource provisioning, andinfrastructure when managing our workloads. However, the previous JupyterNotebook ecosystem, as much as it is a staple in the data scientist toolbox,isn\u2019t meant for these changes:        Figure       : The Notebooks we know only cover a small domain of the data scienceecosystem       As I\u2019ve said, the Jupyter Notebook we\u2019ve come to know isn\u2019t meant for these changes. They\u2019re meant for exploration, not production. They\u2019re meant to run in a singlemachine, not a fleet of pods. However, for the past five years, the JupyterNotebook ecosystem has grown: we now have JupyterLab, several plugins, new kernelsfor other languages, and third-party tooling available at our disposal. Sure,we can still run notebooks by typing        jupyter notebook       in our terminals, butit\u2019s now more than that!       This then begs the question:        what are the forcesthat prompted these changes?       , and        how can we leverage this larger notebookecosystem to respond to the changes in data science today?       The three forces of change       The Jupyter Notebook ecosystem is growing, and I posit that this is driven bythree forces:         Experiment on the Cloud        : big data demands large compute and storage,  something that your average consumer-grade machine will not always capable         Support for developer workflow        : more and more data science teams are  starting to adopt software engineering best  practices\u2014version-control, gitfow, pull requests, and more.         Quick turnaround from analysis to production        : it\u2019s not enough to test  hypotheses under controlled environments. Software written for analysis  should be easily reused for prod.        Figure       : The growth of the Notebook ecosystem is driven by these forces       Growing towards a more Cloud-first environment means that we can performNotebook-based tasks in machines more powerful than our own. For example,managed notebook instances enabled us to run Jupyter notebooks from a remoteserver with no-ops and setup. On the other hand, growing towards a moreProduction workflow provides us with a set of tools to endow our notebook-basedtasks with software engineering practices. We\u2019ll see more of these tools in thenext part of this post.       Finally, note that the growth of a tool doesn\u2019t depend on a single entity ororganization. As we will see later on, filling these gaps may stem fromindividuals who contribute third-party plugins or organizations offering managedservices from notebooks.       Conclusion       In the first part of this series, we looked into the two drivers of growth inthe data science landscape: the (1) adoption of the Cloud, and the (2)increasing demand for production. We saw that Jupyter Notebooks only fill asmall part of this ecosystem, i.e., it\u2019s often used for exploration (notproduction) and only ran in our local machines (not in the Cloud).       Then, using that same framework, we identified three forces of change thatallowed the Jupyter Notebook ecosystem to grow: increased experimentation onthe Cloud, support for developer workflow, and quicker turnaround from analysisto production. These forces may have brought in the development of new tools,plugins, and Notebook-like products to satisfy such gaps.       For the next part of this series, I\u2019ll talk about how we can use JupyterNotebooks given these forces of change. I\u2019ll review some of the tools andworkflows that have helped me in my day-to-day work and side-projects.      Please enable JavaScript to view the       comments powered by Disqus.

At that time, psycopg (one) was the tool touse, and psycopg2 was an interesting experiment.       In several years of using psycopg2 daily and reading about expectations,frustrations, surprises experienced by other users, I have been making my mindabout a better system, and if I had to release a version incompatible with thepast, those are some of the things I would change.        Query parameters adaptation        psycopg2 composes queries (replacing the placeholders in the SQL strings withthe values supplied by the user) on the client, and sends a complete query tothe server.        It does its job right, so it doesn't result in SQL injection vulnerabilities.However the correct way of doing it, as far as PostgreSQL is concerned, shouldbe to send the query and its parameters separately (i.e. using the          PQexecParams        libpq function rather than          PQexec        Separating the statement from the parameters improves performance and memoryusage at parsing time. However the behaviour of the library would changeslightly, which is the reason why server-side merging hasn't been used so far.For instance:          PQexecParams         only supports one command at time: it wouldn't be possibleanymore to send a batch of queries separated by semicolon in a single         call.         psycopg2 helps solving some type casting ambiguities by attaching casts tothe types represented as strings (e.g. the date 1/1/2020 is currently mergedto the query as          PQexecParams         the trickwouldn't be available anymore. It might be possible maybe to suggest thetype in other ways, but if that's not the case then queries should bemodified by applying explicit casts next to their placeholders (e.g.         Custom-defined adapters should be rewritten.        The main difference between the old adaptation protocol (called          ISQLQuoteand the new one (which doesn't have a name yet, it could be probably called         ISQL        ) is the use of the quotes, whereby the string         O'Connor        is passedto the query as        , with wrapping quotes and doubled-up quotes inthe content. In         ISQL        the string wouldn't undergo the same transformationto add and escape quotes; other types would only have to be converted intostrings in the PostgreSQL syntax, but wouldn't need to be wrapped in quotes tocreate a SQL literal. Using         ISQL        as the fundamental adaptation steps therewould be some interesting improvements:         adapting composite types and arrays would be a much more straightforward         it opens the door to the use of          prepared statements         , but especially         the          COPY FROM         operation could take an iterable object yielding Pythontypes instead of a file-like object to read; similarly          COPY TO         couldreturn an iterable object yielding Python types.        I mean: this would be great!          COPY        is by far the most efficient way toinsert data into the database: using it via psycopg2 requires exposing thedata via a         file-like object        , which not only is a weird interface, but itrequires people to roll their own adaptation format. The target for copyingdata into the database using psycopg3 should be as easy as:        Context managers and transactions        psycopg2 follows a de-facto standard (which was         widely discussed        but whichnever landed in the         DBAPI specs        ), whereby connections used as contextmanagers wrap a transaction, committing it if exiting on success or rolling itback in case of error. So the way to use it is something like:        This idea has its usefulness,  but it is a         very        surprising behaviour:developers usually expect the same resources released by        to bereleased on context exit (as files, sockets, and even DBAPI cursors do). Italso gets in the way of managing different life cycles on the connection, forinstance if there is the connection is taken from a pool:        then it is expected (and         reasonably requested        ) that the connection isreturned to the pool at the end of the block.        Talking about transactions, PostgreSQL support for         SAVEPOINT        makespossible to implement nested transactions (already implemented on top of         by Django        and         in a stand-alone module        ). This seems toask for a different context than the connection-scope one. So maybe it wouldbe useful to leave the latter to the management of the resource, releasingthem on connection context exit, and to add an explicit method to start anatomic block (either a transaction or a savepoint, according to the current        Optional C module        psycopg2 is a C extension module wrapping the         libpq        , the PostgreSQL clientlibrary. As such, in order to build, it requires a C compiler, Python, andlibpq development packages. It is a relatively low bar, but it can be a painnonetheless for beginner users.        We tried to avoid the problem by shipping a         wheel package        , but theexperience has been         far from being a success        ,  marred by diverse issuessuch as the possible incompatibility between the libcrypto used by Python andby the libpq, the lack of support for musl libc/Alpine Linux (much in demandin Docker images), broken assumptions (like         glibc breaking backwardscompatibility        )... There's just too much magic needed to work smoothly.        In the past years, mostly in order to support         PyPypsycopg2 implementations have been developed: first a         ctypesimplementation        , to which I contributed but which hasn't been maintained atthe same feature level of the reference C psycopg2. This package was furtherforked into a         cffi implementation        , which seems to be more active, butwhose release numbers don't follow the original ones, which is mighty        psycopg3 might follow an approach I've seen used in other extension modulessuch as PyYAML, which try to compile an optimized version of the library andfall back to a Python implementation if that fails. Using the C module overthe Python module would be a preference at import time, but if could still bepossible to enforce the use of one specific implementation, for instance usinga        environment variable, which would make the lackof the requested implementation an import time error.        Async from the ground up        The DBAPI interface is synchronous and blocking by design:        blocks until a connection is open,        blocks until the query iscompleted etc. This didn't stop psycopg2 to work asynchronously, exposing twodifferent interfaces for it:          a purely asynchronous one         where the application must explicitly         to bring forward the connection/execution process: it breaks theDBAPI interface but allows frameworks who can't make blocking calls anyway(such as the revered          Twisted         ) to use it;          a coroutine-based one         where the DBAPI blocking interface is respectedbut behind the scene psycopg2 collaborates with coroutine libraries such as          Eventlet         and          gevent        Needless to say, the world has gone forward, and Python now offers coresupport in its syntax and library to         asyncio        : this is the foundation thatnewer Python async frameworks, such as         aiohttp        , are built upon. A third-part         aiopg        , currently helps to bridge the async mode of psycopg2 with theasyncio machinery, but of course there is some overhead, mostly caused by thefact that the C implementation of psycopg2 is a relatively thick layer, withthe libpq async calls deeply buried under the C implementation of the Python         connection        and         cursor        objects and behind their interfaces.        There is a chance now to rethink how thick the C libpq wrapper should be. Wecan reduce the C implementation to a minimal wrapper around the libpq(replaceable by a CFFI Python wrapper if compiling C is not available on theclient), using it as a foundation to build a familiar DBAPI blockinginterface. A blocking behaviour is not bad in itself: it allows to write mostof the programs, the ones which don't need crazy concurrency, in a simple andfamiliar paradigm; the async layer would be available under the hood tosqueeze the best performance in programs who have embraced an asynchronouspattern and framework. Time for a picture:        Other improvements        I've written down some of the ideas to implement on         a Trello board        and in         an issues milestone        . As the board shows, some of the improvements weren'tactually incompatible with psycopg2 and over the years they have alreadylanded in in its releases; some other ones will have to wait.        Some of what could be improved over psycopg2:          async COPY methods (see           issue #428          better support for SQL_ASCII databases (which, unlike what their namesuggests, are actually unencoded 8 bits, see           issue #519           preparing cursors          ;          return value on          :          connection and cursor-scoped adapters (currently you can scope theadaptation rules from Postgres to Python but the rules from Python toPostgres can only be global);          reorganising the           extensions          and           extras          module, which at the moment containan heterogeneous assortment of objects, functions, constants...        I would be interested in starting the development of this project soon. If youhave opinions, or interest in the project, please let us know on the         MailingList        (you can         subscribe here        ...and if psycopg2 has been useful so far for you and for your business and ifyou would love to see a psycopg3 even more performing and easier to use,please consider         sponsoring the development        , thank you! \ud83d\udc9c      \u00a9 2020.

Today, they\u2019ve become a central part of many people\u2019s homes and offices and their adoption is only expected to grow. Among the most popular of these devices are those controlled by Amazon Alexa. In this tutorial, you\u2019ll become an        Alexa Python developer       by deploying your own Alexa skill, an application that users will interact with using voice commands to Amazon Alexa devices.        In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn:         What        the main components of an Alexa skill are         How        to set up an Alexa skill and create Intents         What        the         ask_sdk_core        Alexa Python package is         How        to use         ask_sdk_core        to create the business logic of your Alexa Python skill         How        to build, deploy, and test your Alexa Python skill using the online developer console         Free Bonus:         Click here to download a Python speech recognition sample project with full source code        that you can use as a basis for your own speech recognition apps.        Remove ads       Getting Started With Alexa Python Development       To follow this tutorial, you\u2019ll need to make a free Alexa        developer account       . On that page, you\u2019ll take the following steps:        Click the         Get Started        button.        Click the         Sign-Up        button on the subsequent page.        Click         Create your Amazon Account        Fill out the form with the required details.        Click         Submit        to complete the sign-up process.       You\u2019ll also need to be familiar with concepts such as        lists       and        dictionaries       in Python, as well as JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). If you\u2019re new to JSON, then check out        Working With JSON Data in Python       Let\u2019s get started!       Understanding Alexa Skills       An Alexa Python developer must be familiar with a number of different Alexa skill components, but the two most important components are the        interface       and the        service         The skill interface        processes the user\u2019s speech inputs and maps it to an intent.         The skill service        contains all the business logic that determines the response for a given user input and returns it as a JSON object.       The skill interface will be the        frontend       of your Alexa skill. This is where you\u2019ll define the intents and the invocation phrases that will perform a certain function. Essentially, this is the part of the skill that\u2019s responsible for interacting with the users.       The skill service will be the        backend       of your Alexa skill. When a specific intent is triggered by the user, it will send that information as a request to the skill service. This will contain the business logic to be returned along with valuable information to the frontend, which will finally be relayed back to the user.       Setting Up Your Environment       It\u2019s time to start building your first Alexa Python skill! Sign in to the Alexa        developer console       and click on the        Create Skill       button to get started. On the next page, enter the        Skill name       , which will be        Joke Bot       This will be the        invocation phrase       of your skill. It\u2019s the phrase a user will speak to start using your Alexa skill. You can change this to something else later on if you\u2019d like. Also, note that Alexa skills can interact in many languages, which you can see from the        Default Language       dropdown menu. For now, just set it to       Next, you\u2019ll need to choose a model to add to your skill. These        models       are like templates that have been pre-designed by the Amazon team to help you get started with Alexa Python development, based on some common use cases. For this tutorial, you should select the        Custom       model.       Finally, you need to select a method to host the backend of your Alexa skill. This service will contain the business logic of your application.         Note:        If you select the         Provision your own        option, then you\u2019ll have to host your own backend for your Alexa Python projects. This can be an API built and hosted on a platform of your choice. The other option is to create a separate AWS Lambda function and link it to your Alexa skill. You can learn more about AWS Lambda pricing on their         pricing page       For now, select       as the backend for your Alexa skill. This will automatically provide you with a hosted backend within the AWS free tier so you don\u2019t have to pay anything upfront or set up a complicated backend right now.       Finally, click the        Create Skill       button to proceed. You might be asked to fill out a CAPTCHA here, so complete that as well. After a minute or so, you should be redirected to the        Build       section of the developer console.       Understanding the Alexa Skill Model       Once you\u2019ve logged into the Alexa developer console and selected or created a skill, you\u2019ll be greeted with the        Build       section. This section provides you with a lot of options and controls to set up the        interaction model       of the skill. The components of this interaction model allow you to define how the users will interact with your skill. These properties can be accessed through the left-side panel, which looks something like this:       As an Alexa Python developer, there are a few components of an Alexa skill interaction model that you\u2019ll need to know about. The first is the        invocation       . This is what users will say to begin interacting with your Alexa skill. For example, the user will say, \u201cJoke Bot,\u201d to invoke the Alexa skill you\u2019ll build in this tutorial. You can change this from the        Invocation       section at any time.       Another component is the        intent       , which represents the core functionality of your application. Your app will have a set of intents that will represent what kinds of actions your skill can perform. To provide contextual information for a given intent, you\u2019ll use a        slot,       which is a variable in an utterance phrase.       Consider the following example. A sample utterance to invoke the weather intent could be, \u201cTell me about the weather.\u201d To make the skill more useful, you can set the intent to be, \u201cTell me about the weather in Chicago,\u201d where the word \u201cChicago\u201d will be passed as a slot variable, which improves the user experience.       Lastly, there are        slot types,       which define how data in a slot is handled and recognized. For example, the        AMAZON.DATE       slot type easily converts words that indicate a date\u2014like \u201ctoday, \u201ctomorrow\u201d, and others\u2014into a standard date format (such as \u201c2019-07-05\u201d). You can check out the official slot type        reference page       to learn more.         Note:        To learn more about the Alexa skill interaction model, check out the         official documentation       At this point, the        Intents       panel should be open. If it\u2019s not, then you can open it by selecting        Intents       from the sidebar on the left. You\u2019ll notice that there are five intents already set up by default:       The        Intents       panel includes a        HelloWorldIntent       and five        Built-in Intents       . The built-in intents are there to remind you to account for some common cases that are important to making a user-friendly bot. Here\u2019s a brief overview:         AMAZON.CancelIntent        lets the user cancel a transaction or task. Examples include, \u201cNever mind,\u201d \u201cForget it,\u201d \u201cExit,\u201d and \u201cCancel,\u201d though there are others.         AMAZON.HelpIntent        provides help about how to use the skill. This could be used to return a sentence that serves as a manual for the user on how to interact with your skill.         AMAZON.StopIntent        allows the user to exit the skill.         AMAZON.NavigateHomeIntent        navigates the user to the device home screen (if a screen is being used) and ends the skill session.       By default, there are no sample utterances assigned to trigger these intents, so you\u2019ll have to add those as well. Consider it part of your training as an Alexa Python developer. You can learn more about these built-in intents in the        official documentation        Remove ads       Viewing a Sample Intent       Later in this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to make a new intent, but for now, it\u2019s a good idea to take a look at some existing intents that are part of every new skill you create. To start, click the        HelloWorldIntent       to see its properties:       You can see the sample utterances that a user can speak to invoke this intent. When this intent is invoked, this information is sent to the backend service of your Alexa skill, which will then execute the required business logic and return a response.       Below this, you have the option to set up the        Dialog Delegation Strategy       , which allows you to delegate a specific        dialog       that you define to a particular intent. While you won\u2019t cover this in this tutorial, you can read more about it in the        official documentation       Next, you have the option to define        slots       for some particular data that your intent is supposed to collect. For example, if you were to create an intent that tells the weather for a given day, then you\u2019d have a        Date       slot here that would collect the date information and send it to your backend service.         Note:        In addition, the         Intent Confirmation        option can be useful in a case when you\u2019re collecting a number of different data points from your user in a single intent and you want to prompt the user before sending it on for further processing.       Whenever you make changes to an intent, you need to click the        Save Model       button to save it. Then, you can click the        Build Model       button to go ahead and test your Alexa Python skill.       It\u2019s helpful to know that the interaction model of a skill can be completely represented in a        JSON       format. To see the current structure of your Alexa skill, click the        JSON Editor       option from the left side panel of the console:       If you make a change directly using the JSON editor, then the changes are also reflected in the developer console UI. To test this behavior, add a new intent and click        Save Model       Once you\u2019ve made all the necessary changes to the interaction model of your skill, you can open the        Test       section of the developer console to test out your skill.        Testing       is an important part of becoming an Alexa Python developer, so be sure not to skip this step! Click the        Test       button from the top navigation bar on the developer console. By default, testing will be disabled. From the drop-down menu, select        Development       to start testing:       Here, you have a number of ways that you can test out your Alexa Python skill. Let\u2019s do a quick test so that you can get an idea of how your Alexa skill will respond to an utterance.       Select the        Alexa Simulator       option from the left side panel, then enter the phrase, \u201cHey Alexa, open Joke Bot.\u201d You can do this either by typing it in the input box or by using the        Mic       option. After a couple of seconds, a response will be returned back to you:       In addition to the voice response, you can also see the        JSON Input       that was sent to the backend service of your Alexa skill, as well as the        JSON Output       that was received back to the console:       Here\u2019s what\u2019s happened so far:         The JSON input object        was constructed from input data that the user entered through voice or text.         The Alexa simulator        packaged up the input along with other relevant metadata and sent it to the backend service. You can see this in the         JSON Input        box.         The backend service        received the input JSON object and parsed it to check the type of the request. Then, it passed the JSON to the relevant intent handler function.         The intent handler function        processed the input and gathered the required response, which is sent back as a JSON response to the Alexa simulator. You can see this in the         JSON Output        box.         The Alexa simulator        parsed this JSON and read the speech response back to you.         Note:        You can read about the JSON request-response mechanism for Alexa skills in the         official docs       Now that you have an overview of the different components of an Alexa skill and how information flows from one part to the other, it\u2019s time to start building your Joke Bot! In the next section, you\u2019ll put your Alexa Python developer skills to the test by creating a new intent.        Remove ads       Creating New Intents       Let\u2019s start by creating the        JokeIntent       , which will return a random joke from a list to the user. Open the        Build       section of your Alexa developer console. Then, click the        Add       button next to the        Intents       option from the left side panel:       With the        Create custom intent       option selected, set the name to        JokeIntent       and then click the        Create custom intent       button:       Next, you need to add        sample utterances       that the user will speak to invoke this intent. These can be phrases like \u201cTell me a joke\u201d or \u201cI want to hear a joke.\u201d Type in a phrase and click the plus sign (       ) to add it as a sample utterance. Here\u2019s what that should look like:       You can add more sample utterances, but for now, these will do just fine. Lastly, click the        Save Model       button in the top-left corner of the window to save these changes.       Remember, you\u2019ll need to        build your model       before you can test it out. Click the        Build Model       button to re-build the interaction model of your Alexa Python skill. You\u2019ll see a progress notification on the bottom-right of your browser window. Once the build process is successful, you should see another pop-up notification indicating the status of the build process.       You can check to see if the        JokeIntent       is successfully triggered or not. Click the        Evaluate Model       button in the top-right corner of the developer console. A small window will pop in from the side allowing you to check what intent will be triggered by a given input utterance. Type in any of the sample utterances to make sure that the        JokeIntent       is being invoked successfully.       To get rid of the evaluate pop-up window, click the        Evaluate Model       button again.         Note:        A key thing to remember here is that the model is very flexible in terms of the keywords that are part of the sample utterance phrases. For example, take the phrase, \u201cIs this some kind of a joke?\u201d Even this phrase will trigger the         JokeIntent        . As an Alexa Python developer, it\u2019s important to select utterances that have a low probability of executing other intents in your skill.       Now that you\u2019ve successfully created an intent, it\u2019s time to write the Python code that will handle this intent and return back a joke as a response.       Building the Skill Backend       Now that you have an intent created that can be triggered by the user, you need to add        functionality       in the skill backend to handle this intent and return useful information. Open the        Code       section of the Alexa developer console to get started.         Note:        Since you selected the Alexa-Hosted Python option during the setup process, you\u2019re provided with a complete online code editor where you can write, test, build, and deploy the backend of your Alexa skill, all within the developer console.       When you open the        Code       section of the developer console, you can see an online code editor with some files already set up for you to get started. In particular, you\u2019ll see the following three files in the        lambda       sub-directory:        This is the main entry point of the backend service. All the request data from the Alexa intent is received here and is supposed to be returned from this file only.         requirements.txt:        This file contains the list of Python packages that are being used in this project. This is especially useful if you\u2019re choosing to set up your own backend service instead of using what\u2019s provided by Amazon. To learn more about requirements files, check out         Using Requirements Files        This file contains some utility functions required for the lambda function to interact with the         Amazon S3        service. It contains some sample code on how to fetch data from an Amazon S3 bucket, which you might find useful later on. Right now, this file is not being used in         lambda_function.py       For now, you\u2019ll only be making changes in        lambda_function.py       , so let\u2019s take a closer look at the structure of the file:       First, you import the necessary utilities that were provided in the       Alexa Python package. Then, there are three main tasks you need to perform in        lambda_function.py       to handle a request from an intent received from the front-end of the Alexa skill:         Create an intent handler class,        which inherits from the         AbstractRequestHandler        class, with functions        and        . There are already a couple of handler classes defined in         lambda_function.py        , such as         LaunchRequestHandler         HelpIntentHandler        , and so on. These handle the fundamental intents of an Alexa skill. An important point to note here is that you need to create a new intent handler class for each of the intents you define.         Create a          SkillBuilder         object,        which acts as the entry point for your Alexa Python skill. This routes all the incoming request and response payloads to the intent handlers that you define.         Pass the intent handler class        as an argument to        so that they\u2019re called in order whenever a new request is received. The         SkillBuilder        is a         singleton        , so only one instance of it is needed to handle the routing of all incoming requests.       This is a good time for you to go through        lambda_function.py       . You\u2019ll notice that the same pattern is followed over and over again to handle different intents that can be triggered by your Alexa Python skill.       Now that you have a broad overview of all the different things you need to do to handle an intent in your backend, it\u2019s time to write the code that will handle the        JokeIntent       that you built in the previous section.        Remove ads       Creating the JokeIntent Handler       Since the important utilities from the       Alexa Python package have already been imported, you don\u2019t need to import them again. If you want to learn more about these in-depth, then you can check out the        official documentation       Next, you\u2019ll create a new        intent handler       that will handle the request received from the        JokeIntent       . In the code snippet below, the intent handler will simply return with a sample phrase. This indicates that the response to the        JokeIntent       was received from the backend. Add the following code to        lambda_function.py       above the class definition of        LaunchRequestHandler()       Let\u2019s take a look at what each section does. In        line 20       you create a new intent handler class for the        JokeIntent       , which is a child class of the        AbstractRequestHandler       class. When you create an intent in the frontend, you need to create an intent handler class in the backend that can handle requests from Alexa. The code you write for this needs to do two things:        recognizes each incoming request that Alexa sends.          JokeIntentHandler.handle()        returns an appropriate response.       In        line 21       you define       . It takes in        handler_input       as a parameter, which is an object of type       that contains all the input request information. Then, it uses       or       to check whether the JSON input it received can be handled by this intent handler function or not.       You use       and pass in the name of the intent. This returns a        predicate       , which is a function object that returns        True       if the given        handler_input       originates from the indicated intent. If this is true, then the        SkillBuilder       object will call        JokeIntentHandler.handle()         Note:        If the         JokeIntent        is triggered from the Alexa skill frontend, then it will send a JSON object containing a key         type        in the body of         request        that indicates that the intent named         JokeIntent        was received as input.       This statement subsequently calls       , which you define in        line 24       . This method receives the input request along with any other important information that might be needed. It contains the business logic that\u2019s required to successfully handle a particular intent. In the case of the        JokeIntent       , this method is required to send a response containing a joke back to the Alexa frontend.       The        speak_ouput       variable contains the sentence which will be spoken back to the user by the Alexa skill frontend.       indicates what the Alexa frontend will play to the user as speech.       can be used to ask a follow-up question. In this method, an object of class        response_builder       returns the response back to the Alexa skill.         Note:        A default response message (         Sorry, I had trouble doing what you asked. Please try again.        ) will be sent back if        does not exist.       Notice that the value of        speak_output       is set to a fixed response right now. You\u2019ll change this later on to return a random joke from a list of jokes.       Here\u2019s what your code looks like in an editor:       Once you\u2019ve created an intent handler class, you need to pass it as an argument to        SkillBuilder.add_request_handler       . Scroll to the bottom of        lambda_function.py       and add the following line:       An important thing to note here is that the placement of this line is important, as the code is processed from top to bottom. So, make sure that the call for your custom intent handler is above the call for the        InstantReflectHandler()       class. This is how it should look:       Alright, it\u2019s time to test your code! Click the        Deploy       button to save the changes and deploy the backend service. You\u2019ll be checking whether it\u2019s going to work as expected from the Alexa skill frontend.       Once the Deploy process is successful, head back to the        Test       section of the developer console and invoke the        JokeIntent       . Remember, enter the utterance phrase to invoke your Alexa Python skill, then input a phrase to execute an intent:       If you get a response similar to the one in the image above, then it means you\u2019ve successfully created an intent handler for the        JokeIntent       in your skill\u2019s backend service. Congratulations! Now, all that\u2019s left to do is to return a random joke from a list back to the skill frontend.        Remove ads       Adding Jokes       Open the        Code       section of the developer console. Then, add the        jokes       variable in        lambda_function.py       Here,        jokes       is a variable of type        list       containing some one-liner jokes. Make sure to add this outside of a function or class definition so that it has        global scope         Note:        Since this list will only be referenced by the         JokeIntentHandler()        class, it doesn\u2019t really matter if you declare this in the body of a function or not. However, doing it this way does help the function body to be free of clutter.       Next, you\u2019ll add the functionality that       needs to randomly pick one joke from the list of jokes and return it to the user. Modify the body of        JokeIntentHandler.handle()       with the following code:       In the body of       , you select a random joke from the list        jokes       using       and return it back as a response to the Alexa skill frontend.       Finally, import the        random       package by adding an import statement to the top of        lambda_function.py       This is how the editor should look at this point:       There\u2019s one final change to make before testing. You need to allow Alexa to give an        acknowledgment       that the skill has been triggered. To do this, look inside        LaunchRequestHandler.handle()       for the        speak_output       variable and set its value to the text in the highlighted line below:       Your Joke Bot is ready for final testing! Click the        Deploy       button to save the changes and head back to the        Test       section of the developer console. This time, you should see a new greeting message when your skill is first invoked. Then, when you ask the bot to tell you a joke, it should give you a different joke every time:       That\u2019s it! You\u2019ve successfully created your first skill as an Alexa Python developer!       Conclusion       Congratulations on taking your first steps into Alexa Python development! You\u2019ve now successfully built your very own Alexa Python skill. You now know how to create a new skill, create intents, write Python code to handle those intents, and return valuable information back to the user.        Level-up your skills by trying some of the following:         Increase        the list of jokes in the backend.         Create        a new Intent named         Trivia        which will respond with a fun trivia fact.         Publish        your skill to the Amazon Marketplace.

This is usually the right thing to do; when              extend             ing you're usually expecting to add more later, and similarly for generalized unpacking, it's assumed that multiple things will be added one after the other.             is not the normal case; Python assumes there are multiple items or iterables being added to the              list             (             ), so overallocation saves work in the common case.             By contrast, a              list             constructed from a single, presized iterable (with             ) may not grow or shrink during use, and overallocating is premature until proven otherwise;              Python recently fixed a bug that made the constructor overallocate even for inputs with known size             .             As for              list             comprehensions, they're effectively equivalent to repeated              append             s, so you're seeing the final result of the normal overallocation growth pattern when adding an element at a time.             To be clear, none of this is a language guarantee. It's just how CPython implements it. The Python language spec is generally unconcerned with specific growth patterns in              list             (aside from guaranteeing amortized              append             s and              pop             s from the end). As noted in the comments, the specific implementation changes again in 3.9; while it won't affect             , it could affect other cases where what used to be \"build a temporary              tuple             of individual items and then              extend             with the              tuple             \" now becomes multiple applications of              LIST_APPEND             , which can change when the overallocation occurs and what numbers go into the calculation.               share               |               improve this answer                edited                 Mar 7 at 17:00               answered                Mar 5 at 17:49                ShadowRanger                ShadowRanger                 84.4k                  6                 6 gold badges                  92                 92 silver badges                  142                 142 bronze badges                 4                 @StefanPochmann: I'd read the code before (which is why I knew this already).

Let\u2019s have a look on how to use it for an open source Python package.       This is the followup to my article on        Python in Azure Pipelines       and while Azure Pipelines are more advanced, my current recommendation for most people is to switch to GitHub Actions for its simplicity and better integration.       Assumptions       This is not meant to be exhaustive documentation on using GitHub Actions for Python packages. It focuses on a certain \u2013 and quite common \u2013 setup and is the guide I wished I had when I started moving my projects myself. It works best if the following is true:        You\u2019re following along using the repository that will run the CI \u2013         not        a private fork.        You\u2019re using          tox        to manage your test environment and would like to re-use them in CI          1        You only need the Python versions that are         provided by GitHub Actions          2       If some of those assumptions aren\u2019t true, you\u2019ll still find value in this article, but you\u2019ll have to improvise or leave things out.       Running Your Tests       To get started, click the \u201cActions\u201d tab in your GitHub project \u2013 it\u2019s right next to \u201cPull requests\u201d. All workflows presented as examples use a different development model than I like, so we\u2019ll start with \u201cSkip this: Set up a workflow yourself\u201d.       You get thrown into a text field with the workflow YAML. Delete their template and paste the following instead:    strategy:      matrix:        with:          set -xe          python -VV          python -m site          python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel          python -m pip install --upgrade coverage[toml] virtualenv tox tox-gh-actions       Don\u2019t forget to adapt the list of        python-version       to your own requirements, but do        not       add        tox       environments anywhere just yet.       I will explain the environment variable        USING_COVERAGE       in the section on measuring and reporting coverage and you can ignore it for now (or even delete it, if you don\u2019t care about coverage at all).       Click the green \u201cStart commit\u201d button in the top right and        make sure you select the \u201cCreate a new branch for this commit and start a pull request.\u201d radio button       Give the branch a memorable name (e.g.        github-actions       ) and subsequently click \u201cCreate pull request\u201d. We\u2019ll need to do more changes and it\u2019s nice to have a branch and a pull request that will try to run the tests against your changes. And we\u2019ll do all our remaining changes in GitHub\u2019s web interface too!       For that switch to the \u201cCode\u201d tab on the far left, click the \u201cBranch: master\u201d button, and select your newly created branch.       You may have already noticed that we installed the        tox       plugin         tox-gh-actions       . It\u2019s a very nice helper that allows you to run        tox       in GitHub Actions without specifying what environments to run, based on the version that is running        tox       itself. To make it work, you have to configure it; so open your        tox.ini       and add a block like this:    pypy3: pypy3       It maps GitHub Actions Python version numbers to        tox       environment versions. A few remarks:        You don\u2019t have to specify all permutations of an environment.         tox-gh-actions        will run         py38        as well as         py38-foo        , and         py38-bar        if they exist. This distinguishes it from         tox        \u2019s         tox -e py        feature, that would only run         py38        Make sure the Python versions in        match those in the environments (and, if you run         pre-commit        from         tox        : those in        ). They\u2019ll fail otherwise due to missing interpreters.        Since all tests for a Python single version run sequentially in one container, you lose some benefits of concurrency. In this case, the Python 3.8 environment takes the longest by far because it also runs all the linting. I personally find the simplicity worth this tradeoff but everyone has to decide for themselves.       At this point, your GitHub Actions CI should pass. You should double check that all Python versions run all the        tox       environments that you expect them to run.       Cleanup       Now that you\u2019re running your tests in GitHub Actions, it\u2019s time to clean up.        Remove your old CI\u2019s configuration (e.g.        or         azure-pipelines.yml        ) from your repository.          Possibly delete the projects from their sites.         Replace your CI badge in the README. For reST, it should look something like this:         If you\u2019re using branch protection, remove the old CI from Settings \u2192 Branches \u2192 Branch protection rules \u2192 master \u2192 Edit and mark the new GitHub Actions checks as required.         There may be references to your old CI system throughout your documentation. It\u2019s best to grep your repository for its name and hostname.       Summary       Congratulations, your project is running in GitHub Actions! With very little work, we\u2019ve got a well-integrated, decently fast CI solution!       If you\u2019d like to see a        complete       Azure Pipelines to GitHub Actions transition, check out        this         structlog        commit       You will notice that there\u2019s more stuff going on and if you\u2019re interested in that, feel free to dive into the following bonus topics!       Coverage       Technically, all you need to upload your coverage data to Codecov is adding the following two steps:      - name: \"Upload coverage to Codecov\"        with:       First convert        coverage       \u2019s data to XML         3       , then run the official        Codecov action       to upload your coverage to Codecov without storing the project\u2019s secret Codecov key in GitHub.       And maybe that\u2019s good enough for you! In which case you can remove the whole        env:       block that sets        USING_COVERAGE       and        skip       the rest of this section.        My       life however is        never       this simple so my coverage setup is a bit more involved:       Firstly,        I measure coverage in parallel mode       which means that I have to run        coverage combine       before I can convert it to XML.       More importantly: I don\u2019t run        all       my environments using        coverage       , because it has a noticeable performance impact on larger test suites \u2013 especially on        PyPy       . So I only pick those environments that I need to cover all my code \u2013 commonly 3.8 and 2.7.       But since        coverage combine       and        coverage xml       would fail if run in a directory without coverage data, I have to make their runs        conditional       . For that I create the environment variable        USING_COVERAGE       that you have seen before and add all Python versions that        do       run using coverage (i.e.        coverage run       or        pytest-cov       ) separated by commas         4       Now I check using the        function       whether the currently active Python version (        matrix.python-version       ) is in the string. If yes, it combines the coverage, converts it into an XML file, and uploads it to Codecov:          set -xe          python -m coverage combine          python -m coverage xml      - name: \"Upload coverage to Codecov\"        with:       I have to protect the Codecov action with another        if       condition so I can use       . This is essential because Codecov has grown unreliable over the years         5       and if an upload fails, I want        that job       to fail too \u2013 instead of Codecov failing a pull request due to ostensibly missing coverage.       Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t cover one failure scenario of Codecov\u2019s flakiness: sometimes it succeeds but fails to update the GitHub check. That means: all your builds pass, if you go to Codecov\u2019s website it reports 100%, but the Codecov check is still failing with some amount of missing percentage.       And sadly, you cannot restart a GitHub Actions workflow if it succeeded, thus there is no easy way to get out of this situation. The simplest one is to send an empty commit to trigger a new build.       But long term we should probably look for ways to stop relying on services for coverage reporting. The only serious competitor Coveralls doesn\u2019t support Python coverage data in their official action and if you use the PyPI package by hand, GitHub Actions won\u2019t inject the necessary secret token into the build if run from a fork (ie. a pull request by a contributor) \u2013 rendering it pointless.       Ensure You Can Build Your Package       I personally prefer to release my packages using        local automation       but it\u2019s still nice to continuously make sure that your package builds and your PyPI long description renders properly.       Since I use         setuptools       for packaging and isolated builds, my job looks like this:        with:        run: \"python -m pip install pep517 twine\"       This doesn\u2019t actually        do       anything with the package except checking it using         twine       , but that\u2019s something you can change easily.       Ensure Your Dev Environment Works Everywhere       I do all my development on macOS and my packages are usually platform agnostic \u2013 however, I have managed to break the development environment on Windows before. Thus to prevent that from happening again in the future, I have the following job that checks whether the package can be installed in development mode and subsequently be imported on all three major platforms:    strategy:      matrix:        with:       It assumes that your package has an extra dependency called        dev       that my projects have for installing all packages that you need to work on them locally \u2013 including building their documentation. If you\u2019d like to know more about how I run my FOSS projects,        I gave a talk on it in 2019       Please note that the last line is the        only       line containing the project name \u2013 in this case         structlog       . The rest of your workflow file is easily copy-and-paste-able.       Further Reading         GitHub Actions for Python        \u2013 the official documentation.           Workflow syntax for GitHub Actions          \u2013 useful when you want to adapt my examples.         PyPI publish GitHub Action        \u2013 publish your package right from the CI.         Hypermodern Python Chapter 6: CI/CD        \u2013 achieves similar goals but uses          nox        instead of         tox        and          Poetry        instead of         setuptools         GitHub Actions for GitHub Pages        : auto-publish static sites like         Sphinx         mkdocs         Pelican        , or         Hugo        to         GitHub Pages        . I         strongly        recommend using         Read the Docs        for documentation though.       Footnotes          Here\u2019s         a rather simple example of how I use          tox          \u21a9\ufe0e         You can of course use the           deadsnakes          PPA         on their Linux runners since they are based on Ubuntu.          \u21a9\ufe0e         You may have been using the          pip         installable Codecov that can handle a          .coverage         file directly. That\u2019s not true for for the Coverage action which requires an XML coverage file.          \u21a9\ufe0e         Please note that          USING_COVERAGE         is a flat string and me using a comma-separated list is just my own convention.          \u21a9\ufe0e         My by far          biggest         GitHub Actions feature request at the moment is to be able to rerun only certain jobs \u2013 ideally certain matrix combination. The chance that          another         Codecov upload will fail on the second build is sadly not zero.          \u21a9\ufe0e        Hynek Schlawack        In \u2665 with \ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa, Python, Go, and networks.

Mocking Asynchronous Functions In Python     Tue, Feb 18, 2020     Introduction     You might have already heard about Python\u2019s      asyncio     module, it allows you to easily run concurrentcode using Python.In the last few months I\u2019ve worked in some codebases which take advantage of the benefits of      asyncio     , mainly through their use of      aiohttp     When using      asyncio     you\u2019ll use the      async/await     keywords to both define and callasynchronous functions.This also means changes in the way you test your code because, unlike ordinary functions,asynchronous functions always return a coroutine object, which needs to be awaited, using the      await     keyword in order to actually schedule it, run it and get the actual return value.     As such, let\u2019s take a quick look into how we can easily test asynchronous functions by leveraging      Futures     in Python 3.7 and      AsyncMock     in Python 3.8     What we\u2019re mocking     In this example, we\u2019re going to be mocking a simple function which adds two integers, its parameters,while resorting to      asyncio.sleep     to simulate IO heavy tasks, for example, HTTP requests or adatabase calls.     Mocking it     Asynchronous functions in Python return what\u2019s known as a      Future     object, which contains theresult of calling the asynchronous function.As such, the \u201csecret\u201d to mocking these functions is to make the patched function return a      Future     object with the result we\u2019re expecting, as one can see in the example below.     As you can see in the example above, we\u2019re creating a pytest fixture, namely      mock_sum     thatpatches the function we created at the beginning of the post and specifies that the function callwill return a      Future     object, with a result of      4In your own tests you will, of course, need to change the call to      set_result     to return whatevervalue you\u2019re expecting, maybe a HTTP response or some database query result.     With this done we can now create a simple test case that tests the      sum     function:     There\u2019s also a few different things happening here when compared to a regular test function:      decorator - This tells pytest that this is an asynchronous test function,otherwise pytest will skip it.      - Defines the asynchronous test function while at the same timecalls the pytest fixture,       mock_sum      , so that it successfully mocks the       sum      function\u2019s result.      - Correctly calls the asynchronous function using the       await      keyword.     Although      1 + 2     is equal to      3     I\u2019m purposefully asserting that this returns      4     so as to make surethat the fixture is indeed called.If you go ahead and run      pytest     now with the code shown above you should see that indeed itexecutes successfully, passing the tests.     However, imagine that you want to mock the      sum     function multiple times while having a differentvalue provided to      set_result     in the      Future     object. It doesn\u2019t make sense to create multiplefixtures since we\u2019ll be repeatedly patching the same function. In this case we\u2019ll return the      Future     object and call the      set_result     function in the test function, thus,our fixture we\u2019ll now look like:     Notice that we\u2019re not calling      set_result     in the fixture this time around. With the updatedfixture we now need to update the test function to look like this:     Finally, notice now how we\u2019re calling     . If we want the mock to returndifferent values we now just need to change the value provided to      set_result     instead of having tocreate multiple fixture for different tests!     Mocking It In Python 3.8     The code above only works for versions of Python &lt;3.8. In Python 3.8 we need to change the codeslightly because       AsyncMock     hasbeen introduced.     With that said, we can simply change the mocking function to return the      AsyncMock     instance insteadof the      Future     instance.     As you can see in the code above, the main change is that the return value is now set as an      AsyncMock     instance instead of a      Future     instance, and we can also now use the      return_value     argument in the      AsyncMock     instantiation instead of needing to call a function afterwards to setits result.     With the code above our test function will look like the first showed in this blog post, where wedon\u2019t change the result of the mock. However, as we did in the end of the previous section, if weneed to mock the same function multiple times while having different results it\u2019s better if wejust return the      AsyncMock     instance from the fixture and set the      return_value     in the testfunction. As such, our fixture would now look like this:     And with this fixture we could simply update our test function to the following:     Notice that the only change compared to the previous section is that we now set the      return_value     attribute of the mock instead of calling the      set_result     function seeing as we\u2019re now working with      AsyncMock     instead of      Future     . Aside that, the test function looks exactly the same.     Conclusion     In conclusion mocking asynchronous functions in Python is actually easier than I expected at first,mostly because I didn\u2019t really understood how asyncio worked. After some reading and experimentationit turns out it\u2019s quick and easy to do, and it allows you to run concurrent tests, which shouldspeed up your test suite!

In this tutorial, you\u2019ll learn how to        define your own Python function       . You\u2019ll learn when to divide your program into separate user-defined functions and what tools you\u2019ll need to do this.        Here\u2019s what you\u2019ll learn in this tutorial:        How         functions        work in Python and why they\u2019re beneficial        How to         define and call        your own Python function        Mechanisms for         passing arguments        to your function        How to         return data        from your function back to the calling environment         Free PDF Download:         Python 3 Cheat Sheet        Remove ads       Functions in Python       You may be familiar with the mathematical concept of a        function       . A function is a relationship or mapping between one or more inputs and a set of outputs. In mathematics, a function is typically represented like this:       Here,        f       is a function that operates on the inputs        x       and        y       . The output of the function is        z       . However, programming functions are much more generalized and versatile than this mathematical definition. In fact, appropriate function definition and use is so critical to proper software development that virtually all modern programming languages support both built-in and user-defined functions.       In programming, a        function       is a self-contained block of code that encapsulates a specific task or related group of tasks. In previous tutorials in this series, you\u2019ve been introduced to some of the built-in functions provided by Python.       , for example, takes one argument and returns that object\u2019s unique integer identifier:       returns the length of the argument passed to it:       takes an iterable as its argument and returns        True       if any of the items in the iterable are        truthy       and        False       otherwise:       Each of these built-in functions performs a specific task. The code that accomplishes the task is defined somewhere, but you don\u2019t need to know where or even how the code works. All you need to know about is the function\u2019s        interface:        What         arguments        (if any) it takes        What         values        (if any) it returns       Then you call the function and pass the appropriate arguments. Program execution goes off to the designated body of code and does its useful thing. When the function is finished, execution returns to your code where it left off. The function may or may not return data for your code to use, as the examples above do.       When you define your own Python function, it works just the same. From somewhere in your code, you\u2019ll call your Python function and program execution will transfer to the body of code that makes up the function.         Note:        In this case, you will know where the code is and exactly how it works because you wrote it!       When the function is finished, execution returns to the location where the function was called. Depending on how you designed the function\u2019s interface, data may be passed in when the function is called, and return values may be passed back when it finishes.       The Importance of Python Functions       Virtually all programming languages used today support a form of user-defined functions, although they aren\u2019t always called functions. In other languages, you may see them referred to as one of the following:         Subroutines         Procedures         Methods         Subprograms       So, why bother defining functions? There are several very good reasons. Let\u2019s go over a few now.        Remove ads       Abstraction and Reusability       Suppose you write some code that does something useful. As you continue development, you find that the task performed by that code is one you need often, in many different locations within your application. What should you do? Well, you could just replicate the code over and over again, using your editor\u2019s copy-and-paste capability.       Later on, you\u2019ll probably decide that the code in question needs to be modified. You\u2019ll either find something wrong with it that needs to be fixed, or you\u2019ll want to enhance it in some way. If copies of the code are scattered all over your application, then you\u2019ll need to make the necessary changes in every location.         Note:        At first blush, that may seem like a reasonable solution, but in the long term, it\u2019s likely to be a maintenance nightmare! While your code editor may help by providing a search-and-replace function, this method is error-prone, and you could easily introduce bugs into your code that will be difficult to find.       A better solution is to        define a Python function that performs the task       . Anywhere in your application that you need to accomplish the task, you simply call the function. Down the line, if you decide to change how it works, then you only need to change the code in one location, which is the place where the function is defined. The changes will automatically be picked up anywhere the function is called.       The        abstraction of functionality       into a function definition is an example of the        Don\u2019t Repeat Yourself (DRY) Principle       of software development. This is arguably the strongest motivation for using functions.       Modularity       Functions allow        complex processes       to be broken up into smaller steps. Imagine, for example, that you have a program that reads in a file, processes the file contents, and then writes an output file. Your code could look like this:       In this example, the main program is a bunch of code strung together in a long sequence, with whitespace and comments to help organize it. However, if the code were to get much lengthier and more complex, then you\u2019d have an increasingly difficult time wrapping your head around it.       Alternatively, you could structure the code more like the following:       This example is        modularized       . Instead of all the code being strung together, it\u2019s broken out into separate functions, each of which focuses on a specific task. Those tasks are        read        process       , and        write       . The main program now simply needs to call each of these in turn.         Note:        The         def        keyword introduces a new Python function definition. You\u2019ll learn all about this very soon.       In life, you do this sort of thing all the time, even if you don\u2019t explicitly think of it that way. If you wanted to move some shelves full of stuff from one side of your garage to the other, then you hopefully wouldn\u2019t just stand there and aimlessly think, \u201cOh, geez. I need to move all that stuff over there! How do I do that???\u201d You\u2019d divide the job into manageable steps:         Take        all the stuff off the shelves.         Take        the shelves apart.         Carry        the shelf parts across the garage to the new location.         Re-assemble        the shelves.         Carry        the stuff across the garage.         Put        the stuff back on the shelves.       Breaking a large task into smaller, bite-sized sub-tasks helps make the large task easier to think about and manage. As programs become more complicated, it becomes increasingly beneficial to modularize them in this way.       Namespace Separation       A        namespace       is a region of a program in which        identifiers       have meaning. As you\u2019ll see below, when a Python function is called, a new namespace is created for that function, one that is distinct from all other namespaces that already exist.       The practical upshot of this is that variables can be defined and used within a Python function even if they have the same name as variables defined in other functions or in the main program. In these cases, there will be no confusion or interference because they\u2019re kept in separate namespaces.       This means that when you write code within a function, you can use variable names and identifiers without worrying about whether they\u2019re already used elsewhere outside the function. This helps minimize errors in code considerably.         Note:        You\u2019ll learn much more about namespaces in the next tutorial in this series.       Hopefully, you\u2019re sufficiently convinced of the virtues of functions and eager to create some! Let\u2019s see how.        Remove ads       Function Calls and Definition       The usual syntax for defining a Python function is as follows:       The components of the definition are explained in the table below:           Component           Meaning            def           The keyword that informs Python that a function is being defined           A valid Python identifier that names the function           An optional, comma-separated list of parameters that may be passed to the function            :           Punctuation that denotes the end of the Python function header (the name and parameter list)           A block of valid Python statements       The final item,       , is called the        body       of the function. The body is a block of statements that will be executed when the function is called. The body of a Python function is defined by indentation in accordance with the        off-side rule       . This is the same as code blocks associated with a control structure, like an         if       or         while       statement.       The syntax for calling a Python function is as follows:       are the values passed into the function. They correspond to the       in the Python function definition. You can define a function that doesn\u2019t take any arguments, but the parentheses are still required. Both a function definition and a function call must always include parentheses, even if they\u2019re empty.       As usual, you\u2019ll start with a small example and add complexity from there. Keeping the time-honored mathematical tradition in mind, you\u2019ll call your first Python function       . Here\u2019s a script file,        foo.py       , that defines and calls       Here\u2019s how this code works:          Line 1         uses the          def         keyword to indicate that a function is being defined. Execution of the          def         statement merely creates the definition of         . All the following lines that are indented (lines 2 to 3) become part of the body of         and are stored as its definition, but they aren\u2019t executed yet.          Line 4         is a bit of whitespace between the function definition and the first line of the main program. While it isn\u2019t syntactically necessary, it is nice to have. To learn more about whitespace around top-level Python function definitions, check out          Writing Beautiful Pythonic Code With PEP 8          Line 5         is the first statement that isn\u2019t indented because it isn\u2019t a part of the definition of         . It\u2019s the start of the main program. When the main program executes, this statement is executed first.          Line 6         is a call to         . Note that empty parentheses are always required in both a function definition and a function call, even when there are no parameters or arguments. Execution proceeds to         and the statements in the body of         are executed.          Line 7         is the next line to execute once the body of         has finished. Execution returns to this         statement.       The sequence of execution (or        control flow       ) for        foo.py       is shown in the following diagram:       When        foo.py       is run from a Windows command prompt, the result is as follows:       Occasionally, you may want to define an empty function that does nothing. This is referred to as a        stub       , which is usually a temporary placeholder for a Python function that will be fully implemented at a later time. Just as a block in a control structure can\u2019t be empty, neither can the body of a function. To define a stub function, use the         pass       statement:       As you can see above, a call to a stub function is syntactically valid but doesn\u2019t do anything.        Remove ads       Argument Passing       So far in this tutorial, the functions you\u2019ve defined haven\u2019t taken any arguments. That can sometimes be useful, and you\u2019ll occasionally write such functions. More often, though, you\u2019ll want to        pass data into a function       so that its behavior can vary from one invocation to the next. Let\u2019s see how to do that.       Positional Arguments       The most straightforward way to pass arguments to a Python function is with        positional arguments       (also called        required arguments       ). In the function definition, you specify a comma-separated list of parameters inside the parentheses:       When the function is called, you specify a corresponding list of arguments:       The parameters (        qty        item       , and        price       ) behave like        variables       that are defined locally to the function. When the function is called, the arguments that are passed (        6       , and        1.74       ) are        bound       to the parameters in order, as though by variable assignment:           Parameter           Argument            qty           \u2190            6            item           \u2190            bananas            price           \u2190            1.74       In some programming texts, the parameters given in the function definition are referred to as        formal parameters       , and the arguments in the function call are referred to as        actual parameters:       Although positional arguments are the most straightforward way to pass data to a function, they also afford the least flexibility. For starters, the        order       of the arguments in the call must match the order of the parameters in the definition. There\u2019s nothing to stop you from specifying positional arguments out of order, of course:       The function may even still run, as it did in the example above, but it\u2019s very unlikely to produce the correct results. It\u2019s the responsibility of the programmer who defines the function to document what the        appropriate arguments       should be, and it\u2019s the responsibility of the user of the function to be aware of that information and abide by it.       With positional arguments, the arguments in the call and the parameters in the definition must agree not only in order but in        number       as well. That\u2019s the reason positional arguments are also referred to as required arguments. You can\u2019t leave any out when calling the function:       Nor can you specify extra ones:       Positional arguments are conceptually straightforward to use, but they\u2019re not very forgiving. You must specify the same number of arguments in the function call as there are parameters in the definition, and in exactly the same order. In the sections that follow, you\u2019ll see some argument-passing techniques that relax these restrictions.       Keyword Arguments       When you\u2019re calling a function, you can specify arguments in the form       . In that case, each       must match a parameter in the Python function definition. For example, the previously defined function       may be called with        keyword arguments       as follows:       Referencing a keyword that doesn\u2019t match any of the declared parameters generates an exception:       Using keyword arguments lifts the restriction on argument order. Each keyword argument explicitly designates a specific parameter by name, so you can specify them in any order and Python will still know which argument goes with which parameter:       Like with positional arguments, though, the number of arguments and parameters must still match:       So, keyword arguments allow flexibility in the order that function arguments are specified, but the number of arguments is still rigid.       You can call a function using both positional and keyword arguments:       When positional and keyword arguments are both present, all the positional arguments must come first:       Once you\u2019ve specified a keyword argument, there can\u2019t be any positional arguments to the right of it.        Remove ads       Default Parameters       If a parameter specified in a Python function definition has the form       , then       becomes a default value for that parameter. Parameters defined this way are referred to as        default or optional parameters       . An example of a function definition with default parameters is shown below:       When this version of       is called, any argument that\u2019s left out assumes its default value:        In summary:         Positional arguments        must agree in order and number with the parameters declared in the function definition.         Keyword arguments        must agree with declared parameters in number, but they may be specified in arbitrary order.         Default parameters        allow some arguments to be omitted when the function is called.       Mutable Default Parameter Values       Things can get weird if you specify a default parameter value that is a        mutable object       . Consider this Python function definition:       takes a single list parameter, appends the        string       to the end of the list, and returns the result:       The default value for parameter        my_list       is the empty list, so if       is called without any arguments, then the return value is a list with the single element       Everything makes sense so far. Now, what would you expect to happen if       is called without any parameters a second and a third time? Let\u2019s see:       Oops! You might have expected each subsequent call to also return the singleton list       , just like the first. Instead, the return value keeps growing. What happened?       In Python, default parameter values are        defined only once       when the function is defined (that is, when the        def       statement is executed). The default value isn\u2019t re-defined each time the function is called. Thus, each time you call       without a parameter, you\u2019re performing       on the same list.       You can demonstrate this with       The        object identifier       displayed confirms that, when        my_list       is allowed to default, the value is the same object with each call. Since lists are mutable, each subsequent       call causes the list to get longer. This is a common and pretty well-documented pitfall when you\u2019re using a mutable object as a parameter\u2019s default value. It potentially leads to confusing code behavior, and is probably best avoided.       As a workaround, consider using a default argument value that signals        no argument has been specified       . Most any value would work, but        None       is a common choice. When the sentinel value indicates no argument is given, create a new empty list inside the function:       Note how this ensures that        my_list       now truly defaults to an empty list whenever       is called without an argument.        Remove ads       Pass-By-Value vs Pass-By-Reference in Pascal       In programming language design, there are two common paradigms for passing an argument to a function:        A copy of the argument is passed to the function.        A reference to the argument is passed to the function.       Other mechanisms exist, but they are essentially variations on these two. In this section, you\u2019re going to take a short detour from Python and briefly look at        Pascal       , a programming language that makes a particularly clear distinction between these two.         Note:        Don\u2019t worry if you aren\u2019t familiar with Pascal! The concepts are similar to those of Python, and the examples shown are accompanied by enough detailed explanation that you should get a general idea. Once you\u2019ve seen how argument passing works in Pascal, we\u2019ll circle back around to Python, and you\u2019ll see how it compares.       Here\u2019s what you need to know about Pascal syntax:         Procedures:        A procedure in Pascal is similar to a Python function.         Colon-equals:        This operator (        ) is used for assignment in Pascal. It\u2019s analogous to the equals sign (        This function displays data to the console, similar to Python\u2019s       With that bit of groundwork in place, here\u2019s the first Pascal example:       Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on:         Line 12:        The main program defines an integer variable         x         Line 15:        It initially assigns         x        the value         5         Line 17:        It then calls procedure        , passing         x        as an argument.         Line 5:        Inside        , the        statement shows that the corresponding parameter         fx        is initially         5        , the value passed in.         Line 6:         fx        is then assigned the value         10         Line 7:        This value is verified by this        statement executed just before        exits.         Line 18:        Back in the calling environment of the main program, this        statement shows that after        returns,         x        is still         5        , as it was prior to the procedure call.       Running this code generates the following output:       In this example,        x       is        passed by value       , so       receives only a copy. When the corresponding parameter        fx       is modified,        x       is unaffected.         Note:        If you want to see this in action, then you can run the code for yourself using an online Pascal compiler.        Just follow these steps:         Copy the code from the code box above.         Visit the          Online Pascal Compiler         In the code box on the left, replace any existing contents with the code you copied in step 1.         Click          Execute        You should see the same output as above.       Now, compare this with the next example:       This code is identical to the first example, with one change. It\u2019s the presence of the word        var       in front of        fx       in the definition of procedure       on line 3. That indicates that the argument to       is        passed by reference       . Changes made to the corresponding parameter        fx       will also modify the argument in the calling environment.       The output from this code is the same as before, except for the last line:       Again,        fx       is assigned the value        10       inside       as before. But this time, when       returns,        x       in the main program has also been modified.       In many programming languages, that\u2019s essentially the distinction between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference:         If a variable is passed by value,        then the function has a copy to work on, but it can\u2019t modify the original value in the calling environment.         If a variable is passed by reference,        then any changes the function makes to the corresponding parameter will affect the value in the calling environment.       The reason why comes from what a        reference       means in these languages. Variable values are stored in memory. In Pascal and similar languages, a reference is essentially the address of that memory location, as demonstrated below:       In the diagram on the left,        x       has memory allocated in the main program\u2019s namespace. When       is called,        x       is        passed by value       , so memory for the corresponding parameter        fx       is allocated in the namespace of       , and the value of        x       is copied there. When       modifies        fx       , it\u2019s this local copy that is changed. The value of        x       in the calling environment remains unaffected.       In the diagram on the right,        x       is        passed by reference       . The corresponding parameter        fx       points to the actual address in the main program\u2019s namespace where the value of        x       is stored. When       modifies        fx       , it\u2019s modifying the value in that location, just the same as if the main program were modifying        x       itself.        Remove ads       Pass-By-Value vs Pass-By-Reference in Python       Are parameters in Python pass-by-value or pass-by-reference? The answer is they\u2019re neither, exactly. That\u2019s because a reference doesn\u2019t mean quite the same thing in Python as it does in Pascal.       Recall that in Python, every piece of data is an        object       . A reference points to an object, not a specific memory location. That means assignment isn\u2019t interpreted the same way in Python as it is in Pascal. Consider the following pair of statements in Pascal:       These are interpreted this way:         The variable          x        references a specific memory location.         The first statement        puts the value         5        in that location.         The next statement        overwrites the         5        and puts         10        there instead.       By contrast, in Python, the analogous assignment statements are as follows:       These assignment statements have the following meaning:         The first statement        causes         x        to point to an object whose value is         5         The next statement        reassigns         x        as a new reference to a different object whose value is         10        . Stated another way, the second assignment rebinds         x        to a different object with value         10       In Python, when you pass an argument to a function, a similar        rebinding       occurs. Consider this example:       In the main program, the statement        x = 5       on line 5 creates a reference named        x       bound to an object whose value is        5       is then called on line 7, with        x       as an argument. When       first starts, a new reference called        fx       is created, which initially points to the same        5       object as        x       does:       However, when the statement        fx = 10       on line 2 is executed,        rebinds        fx       to a new object whose value is        10       . The two references,        x       and        fx       , are        uncoupled       from one another. Nothing else that       does will affect        x       , and when       terminates,        x       will still point to the object        5       , as it did prior to the function call:       You can confirm all this using       . Here\u2019s a slightly augmented version of the above example that displays the numeric identifiers of the objects involved:       When       first starts,        fx       and        x       both point to the same object, whose       is        1357924048       . After       executes the statement        fx = 10       on line 3,        fx       points to a different object whose       is        1357924128       . The connection to the original object in the calling environment is lost.       Argument passing in Python is somewhat of a hybrid between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference. What gets passed to the function is a reference to an object, but the reference is passed by value.         Note:        Python\u2019s argument-passing mechanism has been called         pass-by-assignment        . This is because parameter names are bound to objects on function entry in Python, and assignment is also the process of binding a name to an object. You may also see the terms pass-by-object, pass-by-object-reference, or pass-by-sharing.       The key takeaway here is that a Python function can\u2019t change the value of an argument by reassigning the corresponding parameter to something else. The following example demonstrates this:       Here, objects of type         int         dict         set         str       , and         list       are passed to       as arguments.       tries to assign each to the string object       , but as you can see, once back in the calling environment, they are all unchanged. As soon as       executes the assignment       , the reference is        rebound       , and the connection to the original object is lost.       Does that mean a Python function can never modify its arguments at all? Actually, no, that isn\u2019t the case! Watch what happens here:       In this case, the argument to       is a        list       . When       is called, a reference to        my_list       is passed. You\u2019ve already seen that       can\u2019t reassign        my_list       wholesale. If        x       were assigned to something else, then it would be bound to a different object, and the connection to        my_list       would be lost.       However,       can use the reference to make modifications inside        my_list       has modified the first element. You can see that once the function returns,        my_list       has, in fact, been changed in the calling environment. The same concept applies to a        dictionary       Here,       uses        x       as a reference to make a change inside        my_dict       . That change is reflected in the calling environment after       returns.        Remove ads       Argument Passing Summary       Argument passing in Python can be summarized as follows.        Passing an immutable object       , like an         int         str         tuple       , or         frozenset       , to a Python function acts like pass-by-value. The function can\u2019t modify the object in the calling environment.        Passing a mutable object       such as a         list         dict       , or         set       acts somewhat\u2014but not exactly\u2014like pass-by-reference. The function can\u2019t reassign the object wholesale, but it can change items in place within the object, and these changes will be reflected in the calling environment.       Side Effects       So, in Python, it\u2019s possible for you to modify an argument from within a function so that the change is reflected in the calling environment. But should you do this? This is an example of what\u2019s referred to in programming lingo as a        side effect       More generally, a Python function is said to cause a side effect if it modifies its calling environment in any way. Changing the value of a function argument is just one of the possibilities.         Note:        You\u2019re probably familiar with side effects from the field of human health, where the term typically refers to an         unintended consequence        of medication. Often, the consequence is undesirable, like vomiting or sedation. On the other hand, side effects         can        be used intentionally. For example, some medications cause appetite stimulation, which can be used to an advantage, even if that isn\u2019t the medication\u2019s primary intent.        The concept is similar in programming. If a side effect is a well-documented part of the function specification, and the user of the function is expressly aware of when and how the calling environment might be modified, then it can be okay. But a programmer may not always properly document side effects, or they may not even be aware that side effects are occurring.       When they\u2019re hidden or unexpected, side effects can lead to program errors that are very difficult to track down. Generally, it\u2019s best to avoid them.       The        return       Statement       What\u2019s a Python function to do then? After all, in many cases, if a function doesn\u2019t cause some change in the calling environment, then there isn\u2019t much point in calling it at all. How should a function affect its caller?       Well, one possibility is to use        function return values        return       statement in a Python function serves two purposes:        It immediately terminates the function and passes execution control back to the caller.        It provides a mechanism by which the function can pass data back to the caller.       Exiting a Function       Within a function, a        return       statement causes immediate exit from the Python function and transfer of execution back to the caller:       In this example, the        return       statement is actually superfluous. A function will return to the caller when it        falls off the end       \u2014that is, after the last statement of the function body is executed. So, this function would behave identically without the        return       statement.       However,        return       statements don\u2019t need to be at the end of a function. They can appear anywhere in a function body, and even multiple times. Consider this example:       The first two calls to       don\u2019t cause any output, because a        return       statement is executed and the function exits prematurely, before the       statement on line 6 is reached.       This sort of paradigm can be useful for        error checking       in a function. You can check several error conditions at the start of the function, with        return       statements that bail out if there\u2019s a problem:       If none of the error conditions are encountered, then the function can proceed with its normal processing.        Remove ads       Returning Data to the Caller       In addition to exiting a function, the        return       statement is also used to        pass data back to the caller       . If a        return       statement inside a Python function is followed by an expression, then in the calling environment, the function call evaluates to the value of that expression:       Here, the value of the expression       on line 5 is       , which is subsequently assigned to variable        s       A function can return any type of        object       . In Python, that means pretty much anything whatsoever. In the calling environment, the function call can be used syntactically in any way that makes sense for the type of object the function returns.       For example, in this code,       returns a dictionary. In the calling environment then, the expression       represents a dictionary, and       is a valid key reference into that dictionary:       In the next example,       returns a string that you can slice like any other string:       Here,       returns a list that can be indexed or sliced:       If multiple comma-separated expressions are specified in a        return       statement, then they\u2019re packed and returned as a        tuple       When no return value is given, a Python function returns the special Python value        None       The same thing happens if the function body doesn\u2019t contain a        return       statement at all and the function falls off the end:       Recall that         None       is falsy when evaluated in a boolean context.       Since functions that exit through a bare        return       statement or fall off the end return        None       , a call to such a function can be used in a boolean context:       Here, calls to both       and       are falsy, so       is as well, and the        else       clause executes.        Remove ads       Revisiting Side Effects       Suppose you want to write a function that takes an integer argument and doubles it. That is, you want to pass an integer variable to the function, and when the function returns, the value of the variable in the calling environment should be twice what it was. In Pascal, you could accomplish this using pass-by-reference:       Executing this code produces the following output, which verifies that       does indeed modify        x       in the calling environment:       In Python, this won\u2019t work. As you now know, Python integers are immutable, so a Python function can\u2019t change an integer argument by side effect:       However, you can use a return value to obtain a similar effect. Simply write       so that it takes an integer argument, doubles it, and returns the doubled value. Then, the caller is responsible for the assignment that modifies the original value:       This is arguably preferable to modifying by side effect. It\u2019s very clear that        x       is being modified in the calling environment because the caller is doing so itself. Anyway, it\u2019s the only option, because modification by side effect doesn\u2019t work in this case.       Still, even in cases where it\u2019s possible to modify an argument by side effect, using a return value may still be clearer. Suppose you want to double every item in a list. Because lists are mutable, you could define a Python function that modifies the list in place:       Unlike       in the previous example,       actually works as intended. If the documentation for the function clearly states that the list argument\u2019s contents are changed, then this may be a reasonable implementation.       However, you can also write       to pass the desired list back by return value and allow the caller to make the assignment, similar to how       was re-written in the previous example:       Either approach works equally well. As is often the case, this is a matter of style, and personal preferences vary. Side effects aren\u2019t necessarily consummate evil, and they have their place, but because virtually anything can be returned from a function, the same thing can usually be accomplished through return values as well.       Variable-Length Argument Lists       In some cases, when you\u2019re defining a function, you may not know beforehand how many arguments you\u2019ll want it to take. Suppose, for example, that you want to write a Python function that computes the average of several values. You could start with something like this:       All is well if you want to average three values:       However, as you\u2019ve already seen, when positional arguments are used, the number of arguments passed must agree with the number of parameters declared. Clearly then, all isn\u2019t well with this implementation of       for any number of values other than three:       You could try to define       with optional parameters:       This allows for a variable number of arguments to be specified. The following calls are at least syntactically correct:       But this approach still suffers from a couple of problems. For starters, it still only allows up to five arguments, not an arbitrary number. Worse yet, there\u2019s no way to distinguish between the arguments that were specified and those that were allowed to default. The function has no way to know how many arguments were actually passed, so it doesn\u2019t know what to divide by:       Evidently, this won\u2019t do either.       You could write       to take a single list argument:       At least this works. It allows an arbitrary number of values and produces a correct result. As an added bonus, it works when the argument is a tuple as well:       The drawback is that the added step of having to group the values into a list or tuple is probably not something the user of the function would expect, and it isn\u2019t very elegant. Whenever you find Python code that looks        inelegant       , there\u2019s probably a better option.       In this case, indeed there is! Python provides a way to pass a function a variable number of arguments with argument tuple packing and unpacking using the asterisk (       Argument Tuple Packing       When a parameter name in a Python function definition is preceded by an asterisk (       ), it indicates        argument tuple packing       . Any corresponding arguments in the function call are packed into a        tuple       that the function can refer to by the given parameter name. Here\u2019s an example:       In the definition of       , the parameter specification        *args       indicates tuple packing. In each call to       , the arguments are packed into a tuple that the function can refer to by the name        args       . Any name can be used, but        args       is so commonly chosen that it\u2019s practically a standard.       Using tuple packing, you can clean up       like this:       Better still, you can tidy it up even further by replacing the        for       loop with the built-in Python function       , which sums the numeric values in any iterable:       Now,       is concisely written and works as intended.       Still, depending on how this code will be used, there may still be work to do. As written,       will produce a        TypeError       exception if any arguments are non-numeric:       To be as robust as possible, you should add code to        check       that the arguments are of the proper type. Later in this tutorial series, you\u2019ll learn how to catch exceptions like        TypeError       and handle them appropriately. You can also check out        Python Exceptions: An Introduction       Argument Tuple Unpacking       An analogous operation is available on the other side of the equation in a Python function call. When an argument in a function call is preceded by an asterisk (       ), it indicates that the argument is a tuple that should be        unpacked       and passed to the function as separate values:       In this example,       in the function call indicates that        t       is a tuple that should be unpacked. The unpacked values       , and       are assigned to the parameters        x        y       , and        z       , respectively.       Although this type of unpacking is called        tuple       unpacking, it doesn\u2019t only work with tuples. The asterisk (       ) operator can be applied to any iterable in a Python function call. For example, a        list       or        set       can be unpacked as well:       You can even use tuple packing and unpacking at the same time:       Here,       indicates that list        a       should be unpacked and the items passed to       as individual values. The parameter specification        *args       causes the values to be packed back up into the tuple        args       Argument Dictionary Packing       Python has a similar operator, the double asterisk (       ), which can be used with Python function parameters and arguments to specify        dictionary packing and unpacking       . Preceding a parameter in a Python function definition by a double asterisk (       ) indicates that the corresponding arguments, which are expected to be        key=value       pairs, should be packed into a        dictionary       In this case, the arguments        foo=1        bar=2       , and        baz=3       are packed into a dictionary that the function can reference by the name        kwargs       . Again, any name can be used, but the peculiar        kwargs       (which is short for        keyword args       ) is nearly standard. You don\u2019t have to adhere to it, but if you do, then anyone familiar with Python coding conventions will know straightaway what you mean.       Argument Dictionary Unpacking        Argument dictionary unpacking       is analogous to argument tuple unpacking. When the double asterisk (       ) precedes an argument in a Python function call, it specifies that the argument is a dictionary that should be unpacked, with the resulting items passed to the function as keyword arguments:       The items in the dictionary        d       are unpacked and passed to       as keyword arguments. So,       is equivalent to       In fact, check this out:       Here,       creates a dictionary from the specified key/value pairs. Then, the double asterisk operator (       ) unpacks it and passes the keywords to       Putting It All Together       Think of        *args       as a variable-length positional argument list, and       as a variable-length keyword argument list.         Note:        For another look at         *args        and        , see         Python args and kwargs: Demystified       All three\u2014standard positional parameters,        *args       , and       \u2014can be used in one Python function definition. If so, then they should be specified in that order:       This provides just about as much flexibility as you could ever need in a function interface!       Multiple Unpackings in a Python Function Call       Python version 3.5 introduced support for additional unpacking generalizations, as outlined in        PEP 448       . One thing these enhancements allow is        multiple unpackings       in a single Python function call:       You can specify multiple dictionary unpackings in a Python function call as well:         Note:        This enhancement is available only in Python version 3.5 or later. If you try this in an earlier version, then you\u2019ll get a          SyntaxError        exception.       By the way, the unpacking operators       and       don\u2019t apply only to variables, as in the examples above. You can also use them with literals that are iterable:       Here, the literal lists       and       are specified for tuple unpacking, and the literal dictionaries       and       are specified for dictionary unpacking.       Keyword-Only Arguments       A Python function in version 3.x can be defined so that it takes        keyword-only arguments       . These are function arguments that must be specified by keyword. Let\u2019s explore a situation where this might be beneficial.       Suppose you want to write a Python function that takes a variable number of string arguments, concatenates them together separated by a dot (       ), and prints them to the console. Something like this will do to start:       As it stands, the output prefix is hard-coded to the string       . What if you want to modify the function to accept this as an argument as well, so the user can specify something else? This is one possibility:       This works as advertised, but there are a couple of undesirable things about this solution:         The          prefix         string is lumped together with the strings to be concatenated. Just from looking at the function call, it isn\u2019t clear that the first argument is treated differently from the rest. To know that, you\u2019d have to go back and look at the function definition.          prefix         isn\u2019t optional. It always has to be included, and there\u2019s no way to assume a default value.       You might think you could overcome the second issue by specifying a parameter with a default value, like this, perhaps:       Unfortunately, this doesn\u2019t work quite right.        prefix       is a        positional parameter       , so the interpreter assumes that the first argument specified in the function call is the intended output prefix. This means there isn\u2019t any way to omit it and obtain the default value:       What if you try to specify        prefix       as a keyword argument? Well, you can\u2019t specify it first:       As you\u2019ve seen previously, when both types of arguments are given, all positional arguments must come before any keyword arguments.       However, you can\u2019t specify it last either:       Again,        prefix       is a positional parameter, so it\u2019s assigned the first argument specified in the call (which is       in this case). Then, when it\u2019s specified again as a keyword argument at the end, Python thinks it\u2019s been assigned twice.        Keyword-only parameters       help solve this dilemma. In the function definition, specify        *args       to indicate a variable number of positional arguments, and then specify        prefix       after that:       In that case,        prefix       becomes a keyword-only parameter. Its value will never be filled by a positional argument. It can only be specified by a named keyword argument:       Note that this is only possible in Python 3. In versions 2.x of Python, specifying additional parameters after the        *args       variable arguments parameter raises an error.       Keyword-only arguments allow a Python function to take a variable number of arguments, followed by one or more additional        options       as keyword arguments. If you wanted to modify       so that the separator character can optionally be specified as well, then you could add an additional keyword-only argument:       If a keyword-only parameter is given a default value in the function definition (as it is in the example above), and the keyword is omitted when the function is called, then the default value is supplied:       If, on the other hand, the parameter isn\u2019t given a default value, then it becomes required, and failure to specify it results in an error:       What if you want to define a Python function that takes a keyword-only argument but doesn\u2019t take a variable number of positional arguments? For example, the following function performs the specified operation on two numerical arguments:       If you wanted to make        op       a keyword-only parameter, then you could add an extraneous dummy variable argument parameter and just ignore it:       The problem with this solution is that        *ignore       absorbs any extraneous positional arguments that might happen to be included:       In this example, the extra argument shouldn\u2019t be there (as the argument itself announces). Instead of quietly succeeding, it should really result in an error. The fact that it doesn\u2019t is untidy at best. At worst, it may cause a result that appears misleading:       To remedy this, version 3 allows a        variable argument parameter       in a Python function definition to be just a bare asterisk (       ), with the name omitted:       The        bare variable argument parameter       indicates that there aren\u2019t any more positional parameters. This behavior generates appropriate error messages if extra ones are specified. It allows keyword-only parameters to follow.       Positional-Only Arguments       As of        Python 3.8       , function parameters can also be declared        positional-only       , meaning the corresponding arguments must be supplied positionally and can\u2019t be specified by keyword.       To designate some parameters as positional-only, you specify a bare slash (       ) in the parameter list of a function definition. Any parameters to the left of the slash (       ) must be specified positionally. For example, in the following function definition,        x       and        y       are positional-only parameters, but        z       may be specified by keyword:       This means that the following calls are valid:       The following call to       , however, is not valid:       The positional-only and keyword-only designators may both be used in the same function definition:       In this example:          x         and          y        are positional-only.          a         and          b        are keyword-only.          z         and          w        may be specified positionally or by keyword.       For more information on positional-only parameters, see the        Python 3.8 release highlights       Docstrings       When the first statement in the body of a Python function is a string literal, it\u2019s known as the function\u2019s         docstring       . A docstring is used to supply documentation for a function. It can contain the function\u2019s purpose, what arguments it takes, information about return values, or any other information you think would be useful.       The following is an example of a function definition with a docstring:       Technically, docstrings can use any of Python\u2019s quoting mechanisms, but the recommended convention is to        triple-quote       using double-quote characters (       ), as shown above. If the docstring fits on one line, then the closing quotes should be on the same line as the opening quotes.        Multi-line docstrings       are used for lengthier documentation. A multi-line docstring should consist of a summary line, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed description. The closing quotes should be on a line by themselves:       Docstring formatting and semantic conventions are detailed in        PEP 257       When a docstring is defined, the Python interpreter assigns it to a special attribute of the function called       . This attribute is one of a set of specialized identifiers in Python that are sometimes called        magic attributes       or        magic methods       because they provide special language functionality.         Note:        These attributes are also referred to by the colorful nickname dunder attributes and dunder methods. The word         dunder        combines the         d        from         double        and         under        from the         underscore        character (        ). You\u2019ll encounter many more dunder attributes and methods in future tutorials in this series.       You can access a function\u2019s docstring with the expression       . The docstrings for the above examples can be displayed as follows:       In the interactive Python interpreter, you can type       to display the docstring for       It\u2019s considered good coding practice to specify a docstring for each Python function you define. For more on docstrings, check out        Documenting Python Code: A Complete Guide       Python Function Annotations       As of version 3.0, Python provides an additional feature for documenting a function called a        function annotation       . Annotations provide a way to attach        metadata       to a function\u2019s parameters and return value.       To add an annotation to a Python function parameter, insert a colon (       ) followed by any expression after the parameter name in the function definition. To add an annotation to the return value, add the characters       and any expression between the closing parenthesis of the parameter list and the colon that terminates the function header. Here\u2019s an example:       The annotation for parameter        a       is the string       , for        b       the string       , and for the function return value the string       The Python interpreter creates a dictionary from the annotations and assigns them to another special dunder attribute of the function called       . The annotations for the Python function       shown above can be displayed as follows:       The keys for the parameters are the parameter names. The key for the return value is the string       Note that annotations aren\u2019t restricted to string values. They can be any expression or object. For example, you might annotate with type objects:       An annotation can even be a composite object like a        list       or a        dictionary       , so it\u2019s possible to attach multiple items of metadata to the parameters and return value:       In the example above, an annotation is attached to the parameter        r       and to the return value. Each annotation is a dictionary containing a string description and a type object.       If you want to assign a default value to a parameter that has an annotation, then the default value goes after the annotation:       What do annotations do? Frankly, they don\u2019t do much of anything. They\u2019re just kind of there. Let\u2019s look at one of the examples from above again, but with a few minor modifications:       What\u2019s going on here? The annotations for       indicate that the first argument is        int       , the second argument        str       , and the return value        float       . But the subsequent call to       breaks all the rules! The arguments are        str       and        float       , respectively, and the return value is a tuple. Yet the interpreter lets it all slide with no complaint at all.       Annotations don\u2019t impose any        semantic restrictions       on the code whatsoever. They\u2019re simply bits of metadata attached to the Python function parameters and return value. Python dutifully stashes them in a dictionary, assigns the dictionary to the function\u2019s       dunder attribute, and that\u2019s it. Annotations are completely optional and don\u2019t have any impact on Python function execution at all.       To quote Amahl in        Amahl and the Night Visitors       , \u201cWhat\u2019s the use of having it then?\u201d       For starters, annotations make good        documentation       . You can specify the same information in the docstring, of course, but placing it directly in the function definition adds clarity. The types of the arguments and the return value are obvious on sight for a function header like this:       Granted, the interpreter doesn\u2019t enforce adherence to the types specified, but at least they\u2019re clear to someone reading the function definition.        Deep Dive: Enforcing Type-Checking        If you were inclined to, you could add code to enforce the types specified in the function annotations. Here\u2019s a function that checks the actual type of each argument against what\u2019s specified in the annotation for the corresponding parameter. It displays         True        if they match ans         False        if they don\u2019t:        (The         inspect        module contains functions that obtain useful information about live objects\u2014in this case, function        A function defined like the one above could, if desired, take some sort of corrective action when it detects that the passed arguments don\u2019t conform to the types specified in the annotations.        In fact, a scheme for using annotations to perform static         type checking        in Python is described in         PEP 484        . A free static type checker for Python called         mypy        is available, which is built on the PEP 484 specification.       There\u2019s another benefit to using annotations as well. The standardized format in which annotation information is stored in the       attribute lends itself to the parsing of function signatures by automated tools.       When it comes down to it, annotations aren\u2019t anything especially magical. You could even define your own without the special syntax that Python provides. Here\u2019s a Python function definition with type object annotations attached to the parameters and return value:       The following is essentially the same function, with the       dictionary constructed manually:       The effect is identical in both cases, but the first is more visually appealing and        readable       at first glance.       In fact, the       attribute isn\u2019t significantly different from most other attributes of a function. For example, it can be modified dynamically. You could choose to use the return value attribute to count how many times a function is executed:       Python function annotations are nothing more than dictionaries of metadata. It just happens that you can create them with convenient syntax that\u2019s supported by the interpreter. They\u2019re whatever you choose to make of them.       Conclusion       As applications grow larger, it becomes increasingly important to modularize code by breaking it up into smaller functions of manageable size. You now hopefully have all the tools you need to do this.

You will get an in-depth look at a Python module called        re       , which contains functionality for searching and matching using a versatile pattern syntax called a        regular expression       \ud83d\udc0d Python Tricks \ud83d\udc8c           Get a short &amp; sweet            Python Trick           delivered to your inbox every couple of days.

But what is a gradient? On what do we descent down and what do we even optimize in the first place?        Those might be some of the questions which come to mind when having the first encounters with Gradient Descent. Let's answer those questions while implementing the Gradient Descent optimization technique from scratch.        Optimizations and loss functions        Many Machine Learning problems require some form of optimization. Usually the algorithm starts with an initial guess as to what the correct answer might be and then slowly adapts its parameters to be less wrong with every consecutive trial.        This learning process through trial and error repeats until the algorithm has learned to \"correctly\" predict the results for the training- and test data it gets fed.        In order to figure out how wrong our algorithm is with its predictions, we need to define the notion of a         loss function        . The loss function compares the guesses and the actual values and turns the differences between the two into a measurement we can use to quantify the quality of our algorithm. Prominent loss function are         Mean squared error         Root mean square error         Sum of squared errors        Imagine that we're plotting the loss (i.e. \"wrongdoing\") the algorithm produces as a surface in a multi dimensional space (such as 3D). Intuitively it seems to make sense to find the \"place\" on this surface where the algorithm is doing the fewest mistakes. That's exactly where Gradient Descent comes into play. With Gradient Descent we take a \"walk\" on this surface to find such a place.        Gradient Descent by example        As we've already discovered, loss functions and optimizations are usually intertwined when working on Machine Learning problems. While it makes sense to teach them together I personally believe that it's more valuable to keep things simple and focused while exploring core ideas. Therefore for the rest of this post we'll solely focus on Gradient Descent as a mathematical optimization technique which can be applied in a variety of different domains (including Machine Learning problems).        A Paraboloid        The first thing we should do is to define the function we want to run the Gradient Descent algorithm on. Most examples explain the algorithms core concepts with a single variable function such as a function drawn from the class of         parabolas        (e.g. \\(x^2\\)). Single variable functions can be easily plotted in a 2 dimensional space along the \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) axes. Besides other nice properties, dealing with only 2 dimensions makes the involved math a whole lot easier. Real world Machine Learning problems however deal with data in an order of magnitude higher dimensions. While there's a slightly steeper learning curve to go from 2D to 3D there's pretty much nothing new to learn to go from 3D to \\(n\\)D. Because of that we'll apply Gradient Descent to a multivariable function with 2 variables.        Most of us studied the properties of quadratic functions via         parabolas        in school. But is there an equivalent function which can be plotted in 3 dimensions? Imagine that you have a parabola and spin it like a centrifuge along its \\(y\\)-axis. What you'd end up with is a surface called a         paraboloid        There are various ways to define paraboloids but in our case let's use the \"         infinite paraboloid        \" which is defined as follows:        Translating the math into code results in:        Simple enough. Next up we should generate some test data, pass it into our         paraboloid        function and plot the results to see if everything works as expected:       <pre><code class=\"language-Python\"># Test data generation (only really necessary for the plotting below)for x in xs:    for y in ys:        Plotting the graph (using the         Plotly        library) can be done with the following code:        Gradients and derivatives         According to Wikipedia        the definition of a gradient is:        I agree that this sounds overwhelming but the core concepts of a gradient are really simple. What this quote from above tries to convey is that for any given point \\(p\\) on the functions plotted surface there's a vector consisting of         partial derivatives        which points in the direction of greatest increase.        With that explanation the only concept we need to sort out is the notion of partial derivatives.        If you've studied         Differential Calculus        you surely came across the topic of         derivatives        . To recap real quick, a derivative measures the sensitivity to change of a functions output with respect to changes in its inputs.        Derivatives can be of different orders. One of the most prominent derivatives you surely came across is the         first-order derivative        which is the slope of a tangent line that tells us whether the function is increasing or decreasing at any given point.        The process of differentiation obeys several         rules        , some of which we'll apply when walking through the example below to refresh our fond memories of Calculus I.        Let's calculate the first-, second- and third-order derivative of the following function:        According to the         differentiation rules        , the first-order derivative is:        The second-order derivative is:        And finally the third-order derivative is:        Why did we do this? As you might recall from above, a gradient is a vector of partial derivatives of function \\(f\\) at point \\(p\\). So in order to compute gradients we need to compute the partial derivatives of our funcion \\(f\\).        We certainly do know how to compute derivatives as we've shown above, but how do we calculate partial derivatives? As it turns out you already know how to calculate partial derivatives if you know how to calculate derivatives. The twist with partial derivatives is that you're deriving with respect to a variable while treating every other variable as a constant.        The second partial derivative calculation follows the same pattern, deriving \\(f\\) with respect to \\(y\\) while treating \\(x\\) as a constant:          Note        And that's it. With those partial derivatives we're now able to compute any gradient for any point \\(p\\) sitting on the plotted surface of function \\(f\\). Let's translate our findings into code:        Descending down the surface        Let's recap what we've accomplished so far. First, we've codified and plotted a function called the \"         infinite paraboloid        \" which is used throughout this post to demonstrate the Gradient Descent algorithm. Next up we studied gradients, taking a quick detour into Differential Calculus to refresh our memories about differentiation. Finally we computed the partial derivatives of our paraboloid function.        Translating the prose into a mental image, we have a function \\(f\\) which produces a surface in a 3 dimensional space. Given any point \\(p\\) on that surface we can use the gradient (via its partial derivatives) to find a vector pointing into the direction of greatest increase.        That's great, but we're dealing with an optimization problem and for a lot of such applications it's usually desirable to find a global or local minimum. Right now, the gradient vector is pointing upwards to the direction of greatest increase. We need to turn that vector into the opposite direction so that it points to the direction of greatest decrease.         Linear Algebra        taught us that doing that is as simple as multiplying the gradient vector by \\(-1\\). Another neat Linear Algebra trick is to multiply a vector by a number other than \\(1\\) to change its magnitude (= its length). If we're for example multiplying the gradient vector by \\(0.25\\) we would get a vector which has length \\(\\frac{1}{4}\\) of its original length.        We finally have all the building blocks in place to put together the Gradient Descent algorithm which eventually finds the nearest local minimum for any given function.        The algorithm works as follows.        Given a function \\(f\\) we want to run Gradient Descent on:         Compute the gradient at point \\(p\\)         Multiply the gradient by a negative \"step size\" (usually a value smaller than \\(1\\))         Compute the next position of \\(p\\) on the surface by adding the rescaled gradient vector to the vector \\(p\\)         Repeat step 2 with the new \\(p\\) until convergence        Let's turn that into code. First, we should define a         compute_step        function which takes as parameters the vector \\(p\\) and a \"step size\" (we call it         learning_rate        Next up we should define a random starting position \\(p\\):# Ensure that we don't start at a minimum (0, 0 in our case)while True:        break        And finally we wrap our         compute_step        function into a loop to iteratively walk down the surface and eventually reach a local minimum:            That's it. We've successfully implemented the Gradient Descent algorithm from scratch!        Conclusion        Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimization algorithm widely used in Machine Learning applications. Given that it's used to minimize the errors in the predictions the algorithm is making it's at the very core of what algorithms enable to \"learn\".        In this post we've dissected all the different parts the Gradient Descent algorithm consists of. We looked at the mathematical formulations and translated those into code, which in our case can be used to find the global minimum on a Paraboloid function \\(x^2 + y^2\\). Note that our implementation was optimized for readability and educational usefulness rather than performance. You might not want to use this code in production.        Modern Machine Learning libraries such as         TensorFlow        or         PyTorch        ship with built-in differentiation capabilities to automatically compute partial derivatives, removing the need to implement the tedious Math yourself.        I hope that this post was helpful and demystified some of the inner workings of Machie Learning libraries you use in your projects on a day to day basis.

This function is usually called        and must have a specific return type and arguments according to the language standard. On the other hand, the Python interpreter executes scripts starting at the top of the file, and there is no specific function that Python automatically executes.        Nevertheless, having a defined starting point for the execution of a program is useful for understanding how a program works. Python programmers have come up with several conventions to define this starting point.         By the end of this course, you\u2019ll understand:         What the special         variable is and how Python defines it         Why you would want to use a         in Python         What conventions there are for defining         in Python         What the best practices are for what code to put into your        Get Started        Defining Main Functions in Python        4 Lessons        18m              1.

See            Building Zipapps (PEP 441)           for details if you're new to the concept of zipped Python application bundles           Unlike shipping a script in a virtualenv built within a single project, you can have a project for the base libraries and other projects for the scripts, including scripts written by end users who are just using your dependencies.           You can also deploy any            PyPI           package that way, with a simple call of            shiv           , as shown in the next section using            Pandas           .           A Practical Example           The following example uses the well-known            Pandas           data science library, but this works for any project built with setuptools or any other build tool creating Python packages that declare their requirements.           So, to create your base library release artifact, install and call            shiv           like this:           Do this in a virtualenv and leave out the           option if you want to keep your account's home directory clean.           Note that we do not provide an entry point here, which means this zipapp drops into the given Python interpreter and is thus usable            as           an interpreter, with the contained  packages available for            import           .           Now we can exploit this to write a script using the zipapp as its interpreter:import reimport sysfrom pathlib import Pathimport pandas as pdEOFchmod +x script           Calling the script produces the following output:Python path:                                                Path0                                  ~/bin/_lib-pandas1                              /usr/lib/python38.zip2                                 /usr/lib/python3.8           If you're familiar with Pandas, you'll instantly recognize the Python path output as coming from a Pandas data frame. \ud83c\udf89           This first execution is a bit slow on startup, because the cache directory you see at the end of the Python path has to be populated first. shiv's boot-strapping code unpacks extension packages containing native code into the file system, so the OS can load them.           The underscore prefix in the zipapp name indicates this is not a command humans would normally use. Alternatively and especially in production you can deploy into e.g.           and then use an absolute path instead of an            env           call as the script's interpreter.

In this article, Archana Iyer discusses some filter processing techniques that can help us get a better quality of data.With the advent of IoT, many types of medical data are now available in the form of sensor data. This data can be from wearable devices, like Fitbit, or from implanted medical devices. But like all sensor data, this data is prone to noise and misleading values.Machine Learning, along with IoT, has enabled us to make sense of the data, either by eliminating noise directly from the dataset or by reducing the effect of noise while analyzing data.What is Pre-processing?In a world of 7 billion people, data is rich and abundant. This has helped several data scientists all across the world to perform various studies on such data. However, every data wrangler has come across data which is very noisy in nature. It is difficult to make sense of the data from that perspective. Hence, to feed a proper set of data into a model, data pre-processing is performed.There are several pre-processing techniques that exist including box-plots, ignoring missing values and sometimes even manually processing the data.This isn\u2019t the first time we have had to deal with noisy data though. Processing noisy signals has been a huge concern over the last few decades. Signal processing techniques developed today are very robust and effective models. In this article, we will port some processing techniques from the audio and signal field and use them to process sensor data. We will take a look at a few filter processing techniques that can help us.Filters in Audio ProcessingAudio filters are a lot different than filters in CNNs. Filters in CNNs perform convolution operations, whereas in audio processing, filters are used to stop or filter out certain signals.Some of the common ones used to remove noisy data from a signal are explained in this section.Low Pass Filters: Devices often record high values due to random spikes in current or voltage. Often times, the device might be put through some adverse conditions, like high G-Forces, temperatures or pressure. During these times the chances of recording very high values increases.Low pass filters can help eliminate the high value data, as it allows only the low values to pass through and \u2018stops\u2019 high values from going through the filter.The limit for a low pass filter can be set manually or they can also be learnt by using machine learning. This is a simple, but powerful, technique that can remove anomalous data.High Pass Filters:\u00a0A high pass filter is the opposite of a low pass filter. Instead of allowing low values to pass through, it allows high values to pass through. This can be used to eliminate zero values during training.Band-pass Filter:\u00a0Band-pass filters combines the best of both worlds. It prevents both high and low values from passing through. As the name band-pass implies, it allows a band of values to pass through the filter.Kalman Filters: Kalman filters that are used specifically to remove noise from data. The Kalman filters were most prominently used in spacecrafts to track the location of the spacecraft and the moon.Traditional tracking algorithms use a sort of integrating controller that has a way of summing up errors in measurements. This leads to large drifts from the actual output in the long run. The Kalman filters were able to change that.The Kalman filter works in two steps \u2013 predict and update. In the first step, the value of the output is given along with a degree of uncertainty. In the update state, the output of the filter is updated based on the new inputs and the current and previous uncertainties. This is a recursive algorithm that gives increasingly accurate outputs with each step, which makes them more powerful.Why Did the World Start Paying Attention to Signal Processing?Digital Signal Processing like many other fields of science traces itself to a very unruly period in history. Interestingly, most of the developments can trace their origins to either World Wars or National Security requirements.In the 1960s, when the Soviets started building nuclear weapons, the Americans got interested as well and set up sensors all around Russia. Unfortunately, like every hardware, the sensor data was full of noise and could not be analyzed. The Fourier Transform was then adapted for practical use to properly pre-process data for analysis.I\u2019ll try to explain to you how Fourier Transforms work and how we process signals to fit our needs.Fourier TransformsDuring J. F. Kennedy\u2019s presidency, IBM was working on this interesting project of understanding Fourier Transform. Unfortunately, they did not have the proper resources, and it took them almost six months to implement their theories.Today, we have it much easier. FFT or Fast Fourier Transform can be implemented using a few lines of python code:from scipy.fftpack import fftimport numpy as npaudio = np.random.rand(N, 1) * 2 - 1audio_fft=fft(audio)Now we\u2019ll try to understand this processing in a simpler way.Fast Fourier Transform (FFT): The advent of Digital Signal Processing started with the understanding of how computation takes places in the real world. Let\u2019s take a scenario of Argand plane geometry, which is popularly used in the complex planes:In a divide and conquer scenario, let us take a number and try to divide it in all possible manners. We can think of multiple scenarios where we can use either two 8s or four 4s to reach the number 16.From this plane, we can say that in order to comprehend the nth roots of unity, we just need to split the multiplication to half, and then decompose correspondingly, thereby reducing our complexity from O(n2) to O(nlogn).Now, let us take a simple sinusoidal wave on python and perform the necessary FFT on it.An important thing to remember is that FFT can be applied to only certain frequencies. Hence, we have taken a normal sine wave to show noise data in order to understand how it works.import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scipy.fftpack import fft, ifftfrom scipy.signal import hammingN = 1024T=1/512x = np.linspace(0.0, N*T, N)sinewave = np.sin(50.0 * 2.0*np.pi*x)sinefft=fft(sinewave)xfft=np.linspace(0.0, (N*T), N)plt.plot(xfft, sinefft)plt.show()WindowingWindowing, as the name suggests, is used to take a small window of the dataset to apply a particular processing to it, as a way to make a signal finite rather than periodic in nature.Applying windows in the time domain also causes ripples in the frequency domain. Windows are applied as another pre-processing technique before the application of DFT or FFT. There are different kinds of windows available in the scipy.signal package.The following code illustrates the use of a Hanning window:import numpy as npimport matplotlib.pyplot as pltfrom scipy.fftpack import fft, ifftfrom scipy.signal import hanningN = 1024T=1/512x = np.linspace(0.0, N*T, N)sinewave = np.sin(50.0 * 2.0*np.pi*x)sinefft=fft(sinewave)xfft=np.linspace(0.0, (N*T), N)hng=hanning(N)win=fft(sinewave*hng)plt.plot(xfft, win)plt.show()The output of the above code looks like this:Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT): As the name suggests, a Discrete Fourier transform is a sinusoidal signal to be decomposed into various frequencies, allowing it to be \u201cdiscrete\u201d in nature.But how does the DFT work in practical sense? Let us look at the equation of a typical DFT:This equation only gives a superficial representation of how each discrete signal might be split within the frequency range. Understanding this at a deeper level lets us look into how a DFT might affect a complex piano version of a song \u201cThe Blue Danube.\u201dThe image here shows how the sample music looks on a spectrogram. As we apply DFT to it, we can see the clear change in the signal.The following code is used to perform a spectrogram on the music:def createA(N,input_length,hop):FH=np.dot(createF(N),hanWindow(N))A=np.zeros(((2*input_length-1)*N,input_length*N),dtype=complex)for i in range(2*input_length-1):A[i*N:(i+1)*N,i*hop:i*hop+N]=FHplot(A)def plot(matrix):matrix_abs=np.abs(matrix)plt.figure()plt.imshow(matrix_abs)plt.xlabel(\\\"Column\\\")plt.ylabel(\\\"Row\\\")plt.colorbar()This spectrogram showcases lower frequency decomposition giving a discrete sample for the entire song.What Type of Dataset Should We Target?Let us take a very simple dataset of ECG recordings of the MIT BIH Noise Stress Database,\u00a0which has a 12-hour ECG recording and a 3-hour noise recording.There was a signal to noise ratio during the noisy segments which are recorded as below:\u00a0RecordSNR (dB)RecordSNR (dB)118e1818119e1818118e1212119e1212118e066119e066118e000119e000118e_6-6119e_6-6This is one of the various examples where several signal processing methods can be applied.Removing noise from a very dirty data set through pre-processing is one of the first steps to applying filters and implementing such data to the real world scenarios.ConclusionOne of the various fields where audio processing can be applied is medical data, which can help millions of lives all around the world. This process can take healthcare to another level by presenting a data goldmine to the scientists.The very first attempt of its kind was by an IBM group that used previous recorded blood samples to determine if there were any traces of cancer in it.Today, the process has evolved a lot. Google DeepMind is working with cancerous tissues to understand how radiation can be further improved. This type of cutting edge application in healthcare is exactly the right place to start using signal processing in ML.\",\"publisher\":{\"@context\":\"http://schema.org/\",\"@type\":\"Organization\",\"url\":\"https://www.womenwhocode.com/\",\"name\":\"Women Who Code\",\"areaServed\":\"Worldwide\",\"email\":\"contact@womenwhocode.com\",\"logo\":{\"@type\":\"imageObject\",\"url\":\"https://cdn.filestackcontent.com/RHJzJuTZQkSwIyQZO226\"},\"address\":{\"@type\":\"PostalAddress\",\"addressLocality\":\"San Francisco\",\"addressRegion\":\"CA\",\"addressCountry\":\"US\"},\"description\":\"Women Who Code (WWCode) is a global 501(c)(3) non-profit organization dedicated to inspiring women to excel in technology careers.

This makes design decisions tough. PostHog solves that.           We also strongly believe 3rd party analytics don't work anymore in a world of Cookie laws, GDPR, CCPA and lots of other 4 letter acronyms. There should be an alternative to sending all of your users' personal information and usage data to 3rd parties.           PostHog gives you full control over all your users' data, while letting anyone easily perform powerful analytics.           It means you can know who is using your app, how they're using, and where you lose users in the sign up process.           What's cool about this?           PostHog is the only            product-focused           open source analytics library, with an event and user-driven architecture. That means tracking identifiable (where applicable) user behavior, and creating user profiles. We are an open source alternative to Mixpanel, Amplitude or Heap, designed to be more developer friendly.           There are a couple of session-based open source libraries that are nice alternatives to Google Analytics. That's not what we are focused on.           One-line docker preview           This image has everything you need to try out PostHog locally! It will set up a server on           .

Please look at the             Documentation           and the relevant             Paper           .            Karate Club           consists of state-of-the-art methods to do unsupervised learning on graph structured data. To put it simply it is a Swiss Army knife for small-scale graph mining research. First, it provides network embedding techniques at the node and graph level. Second, it includes a variety of overlapping and non-overlapping community detection methods. Implemented methods cover a wide range of network science (            NetSci           ,            Complenet            ICDM           ,            CIKM           ,            KDD           ), artificial intelligence (            AAAI           ,            IJCAI           ) and machine learning (            NeurIPS           ,            ICML           ,            ICLR           ) conferences, workshops, and pieces from prominent journals.

Papermill lets you:             parameterize            notebooks             execute            notebooks           This opens up new opportunities for how notebooks can be used. For            Perhaps you have a financial report that you wish to run withdifferent values on the first or last day of a month or at thebeginning or end of the year,             using parameters            makes this task            Do you want to run a notebook and depending on its results, choose aparticular notebook to run next? You can now programmatically             execute a workflow            without having to copy and paste fromnotebook to notebook manually.           Installation           From the command line:           For all optional io dependencies, you can specify individual bundleslike            s3           , or            azure            all           Python Version Support           This library currently supports Python 3.5+ versions. As minor Pythonversions are officially sunset by the Python org papermill will similarlydrop support in the future.           Usage           Parameterizing a Notebook           To parameterize your notebook designate a cell with the tag            parameters           .           Papermill looks for the            parameters           cell and treats this cell as defaults for the parameters passed in at execution time. Papermill will add a new cell tagged with            injected-parameters           with input parameters in order to overwrite the values in            parameters           . If no cell is tagged with            parameters           the injected cell will be inserted at the top of the notebook.           Additionally, if you rerun notebooks through papermill and it will reuse the            injected-parameters           cell from the prior run. In this case Papermill will replace the old            injected-parameters           cell with the new run's inputs.           Executing a Notebook           The two ways to execute the notebook with parameters are: (1) throughthe Python API and (2) through the command line interface.           Execute via the Python API           Execute via CLI           Here's an example of a local notebook being executed and output to anAmazon S3 account:            NOTE:           If you use multiple AWS accounts, and you have            properly configured your AWS  credentials           , then you can specify which account to use by setting the            AWS_PROFILE           environment variable at the command-line. For example:           In the above example, two parameters are set:            alpha           and            l1_ratio           using            -p           (            --parameters           also works). Parameter values that look like booleans or numbers will be interpreted as such. Here are the different ways users may set parameters:           Using            -r           or           , users can set parameters one by one. However, unlike            -p           , the parameter will remain a string, even if it may be interpreted as a number or boolean.           Using            -f           or           , users can provide a YAML file from which parameter values should be read.           Using            -y           or           , users can directly provide a YAML string containing parameter values.           Using            -b           or            --parameters_base64           , users can provide a YAML string, base64-encoded, containing parameter values.           When using YAML to pass arguments, through            -y           ,            -b           or            -f           , parameter values can be arrays or dictionaries:           Supported Name Handlers           Papermill supports the following name handlers for input and output paths during execution:             Local file system:              local             HTTP, HTTPS protocol:             Amazon Web Services:              AWS S3             Azure:              Azure DataLake Store             ,              Azure Blob Store             Google Cloud:              Google Cloud Storage           Development Guide           Read            CONTRIBUTING.md           for guidelines on how to setup a local development environment and make code changes back to Papermill.           For development guidelines look in the            DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md           file. This should inform you on how to make particular additions to the code base.

Support intervals of any (comparable) objects.            Closed or open, finite or (semi-)infinite intervals.            Interval sets (union of atomic intervals) are supported.            Automatic simplification of intervals.            Support comparison, transformation, intersection, union, complement, difference and containment.            Provide test for emptiness, atomicity, overlap and adjacency.            Discrete iterations on the values of an interval.            Dict-like structure to map intervals to data.            Import and export intervals to strings and to Python built-in data types.            Heavily tested with high code coverage.

Documentation &amp; usage           Interval creation           Assuming this library is imported using            import portion as P           , intervals can be easilycreated using one of the following helpers:           The bounds of an interval can be any arbitrary values, as long as they are comparable:           Infinite and semi-infinite intervals are supported using            P.inf           and           as upper or lower bounds.These two objects support comparison with any other object.When infinities are used as a lower or upper bound, the corresponding boundary is automatically converted to an open one.           Empty intervals always resolve to           , regardless of the provided bounds:           Intervals created with this library are            Interval           instances.An            Interval           instance is a disjunction of atomic intervals each representing a single interval (e.g.Intervals can be iterated to access the underlying atomic intervals, sorted by their lower and upper bounds.           Atomic intervals can also be retrieved by position:           For convenience, intervals are automatically simplified:           Note that discrete intervals are            not           supported by            portion           (but they can be simulated though, see            #24For example, combining           with           will            not           result in           even if there isno integer between            1           and            2           .            \u2191 back to top           Interval bounds &amp; attributes           An            Interval           defines the following properties:              i.empty             is              True             if and only if the interval is empty.              i.atomic             is              True             if and only if the interval is a disjunction of a single (possibly empty) interval.              i.enclosure             refers to the smallest atomic interval that includes the current one.           The left and right boundaries, and the lower and upper bounds of an interval can be respectively accessedwith its            left           ,            right           ,            lower           and            upper           attributes.The            left           and            right           bounds are either            P.CLOSED           or            P.OPEN           .By definition,           and vice-versa.           If the interval is not atomic, then            left           and            lower           refer to the lower bound of its enclosure,while            right           and            upper           refer to the upper bound of its enclosure:           One can easily check for some interval properties based on the bounds of an interval:            \u2191 back to top           Interval operations            Interval           instances support the following operations:              i.intersection(other)             and              i &amp; other             return the intersection of two intervals.             and              i | other             return the union of two intervals.              i.complement(other)             and              ~i             return the complement of the interval.              i.difference(other)             and              i - other             return the difference between              i             and              other             .              i.contains(other)             and              other in i             hold if given item is contained in the interval.It supports intervals and arbitrary comparable values.              i.adjacent(other)             tests if the two intervals are adjacent.Two intervals are adjacent if their intersection is empty, and their union is an atomic interval.              i.overlaps(other)             tests if there is an overlap between two intervals.            \u2191 back to top           Comparison operators           Equality between intervals can be checked with the classical           operator:           Moreover, intervals are comparable using e.g.           ,           ,           or           .These comparison operators have a different behaviour than the usual ones.For instance,           holds if            a           is entirely on the left of the lower bound of            b           and           holds if            a           is entirelyon the right of the upper bound of            b           .           Similarly,           holds if            a           is entirely on the left of the upper bound of            b           , and           holds if            a           is entirely on the right of the lower bound of            b           .           Intervals can also be compared with single values. If            i           is an interval and            x           a value, then           holds if            x           is on the left of the lower bound of            i           and           holds if            x           is on theleft of the upper bound of            i           .           This behaviour is similar to the one that could be obtained by first converting            x           to asingleton interval (except for infinities since they resolve to empty intervals).           Note that all these semantics differ from classical comparison operators.As a consequence, some intervals are never comparable in the classical sense, as illustrated hereafter:           Finally, intervals are hashable as long as their bounds are hashable (and we have defined a hash value for            P.inf           and            \u2191 back to top           Interval transformation           Intervals are immutable but provide a            replace           method to create a new interval based on thecurrent one. This method accepts four optional parameters            left           ,            lower           ,            upper           , and            right           :           Functions can be passed instead of values. If a function is passed, it is called with the current correspondingvalue except if the corresponding bound is an infinity and parameter            ignore_inf           if set to            False           .           When            replace           is applied on an interval that is not atomic, it is extended and/or restricted such thatits enclosure satisfies the new bounds.           To apply an arbitrary transformation on an interval, intervals expose an            apply           method.This method accepts a function that will be applied on each of the underlying atomic intervals to perform the desired transformation.The function is expected to return either an            Interval           , or a 4-uple           .           The            apply           method is very powerful when used in combination with            replace           .Because the latter allows functions to be passed as parameters and can ignore infinities, it can beconveniently used to transform intervals in presence of infinities.            \u2191 back to top           Discrete iteration           The            iterate           function takes an interval, and returns a generator to iterate overthe values of an interval. Obviously, as intervals are continuous, it is required to specify the            step           between consecutive values. The iteration then starts from the lower bound and ends on the upper one,given they are not excluded by the interval:           When an interval is not atomic,            iterate           consecutively iterates on all underlying atomicintervals, starting from each lower bound and ending on each upper one:           By default, the iteration always starts on the lower bound of each underlying atomic interval.The            base           parameter can be used to change this behaviour, by specifying how the initial value to startthe iteration from must be computed. This parameter accepts a callable that is called with the lowerbound of each underlying atomic interval, and that returns the initial value to start the iteration from.It can be helpful to deal with (semi-)infinite intervals, or to            align           the generated values of the iterator:           The            base           parameter can be used to change how            iterate           applies on unions of atomic interval, byspecifying a function that returns a single value, as illustrated next:           Notice that defining            base           such that it returns a single value can be extremely inefficient interms of performance when the intervals are \"far apart\" each other (i.e., when the            gaps           betweenatomic intervals are large).           Finally, iteration can be performed in reverse order by specifying            reverse=True           .           Again, this library does not make any assumption about the objects being used in an interval, as long as theyare comparable. However, it is not always possible to provide a meaningful value for            stepbe the step between two consecutive characters?). In these cases, a callable can be passed instead of a value.This callable will be called with the current value, and is expected to return the next possible value.            \u2191 back to top           Map intervals to data           The library provides an            IntervalDict           class, a            dict           -like data structure to store and query dataalong with intervals. Any value can be stored in such data structure as long as it supports           When a value is defined for an interval that overlaps an existing one, it is automatically updatedto take the new value into account:           An            IntervalDict           can be queried using single values or intervals. If a single value is used as akey, its behaviour corresponds to the one of a classical            dict           :Traceback (most recent call last):           When an interval is used as a key, a new            IntervalDict           containing the valuesfor that interval is returned:           By using            .get           , a default value (defaulting to            None           ) can be specified.This value is used to \"fill the gaps\" if the queried interval is not completelycovered by the            IntervalDict           :           For convenience, an            IntervalDict           provides a way to look for specific data values.The            .find           method always returns a (possibly empty)            Interval           instance for which givenvalue is defined:           The active domain of an            IntervalDict           can be retrieved with its            .domain           method.This method always returns a single            Interval           instance, where            .keys           returns a listof disjoint intervals, one for each stored value.           Two            IntervalDict           instances can be combined together using the            .combine           method.This method returns a new            IntervalDict           whose keys and values are taken from the twosource            IntervalDict           . Values corresponding to non-intersecting keys are simply copied,while values corresponding to intersecting keys are combined together using the providedfunction, as illustrated hereafter:           Resulting keys always correspond to an outer join. Other joins can be easily simulatedby querying the resulting            IntervalDict           as follows:           Finally, similarly to a            dict           , an            IntervalDict           also supports            len           ,            in           and            del           , and defines            .clear           ,            .copy           ,            .update           ,            .pop           ,            .popitem           , and            .setdefault           .            \u2191 back to top           Import &amp; export intervals to strings           Intervals can be exported to string, either using            repr           (as illustrated above) or with the            to_string           function.           The way string representations are built can be easily parametrized using the various parameters supported by            to_string           :           Similarly, intervals can be created from a string using the            from_string           function.A conversion function (            conv           parameter) has to be provided to convert a bound (as string) to a value.           Similarly to            to_string           , function            from_string           can be parametrized to deal with more elaborated inputs.Notice that as            from_string           expects regular expression patterns, we need to escape some characters.           When a bound contains a comma or has a representation that cannot be automatically parsed with            from_string           ,the            bound           parameter can be used to specify the regular expression that should be used to match its representation.            \u2191 back to top           Import &amp; export intervals to Python built-in data types           Intervals can also be exported to a list of 4-uples with            to_data            P.CLOSED           and            P.OPEN           are represented by Boolean values            True           (inclusive) and            False           The values used to represent positive and negative infinities can be specified with            pinf           and            ninf           . They default to           and           respectively.           The function to convert bounds can be specified with the            conv           parameter.           Intervals can be imported from such a list of 4-tuples with            from_data           .The same set of parameters can be used to specify how bounds and infinities are converted.            \u2191 back to top           Changelog           This library adheres to a            semantic versioning           scheme.See            CHANGELOG.md           for the list of changes.

Every meeting tries to include something for beginners, and also to tackle advanced topics for seasoned developers. We are all learning, so don't be shy about attending, no matter your experience level! Come discover the feeling of community that emerges when people step forward from behind their blogs and keyboards to talk about their favorite programming language.                  We are currently reorganizing the structure of our meetup group. Read about the Steering Commitee Positions here:                  Participation is free, unless otherwise noted for special events.                  We also have a discord server where you can talk to other locals about python, or ask your python questions!                  If you're just starting to learn Python, we maintain a list of resources to help. (                  )                  If you're looking for Python programmers, we want to help! Please see our Consultants list (                  ) and Recruiter and Job Listing policy (                  ) for details.                 <span>                  Upcoming events (5)                 <span>                  See all                   PyATL Jam Session (In-town)                        <span class=\"eventTimeDisplay-startDate\">                         <span>                          Thu, Apr 2                         </span>                         ,                         <span class=\"eventTimeDisplay-startDate\">                          <span>                           7:00 PM                          </span>                         </span>                        </span>                        PyATL Jam Session (In-town)                        <span>                          </use>                         </svg>                        </span>                         <address>                           Manuels Tavern                         </address>                   <div>                    <div>                     <div>                       What is a Jam Session?Jam Session meetings are intended to be hands-on, collaborative experiences with your fellow PyATL members. Programmers of all experience levels are welcome! We will be meeting from 7pm to 10pm to work together on a coding challenge or on any project you want. We recommend bringing a laptop with you, optionally with Python installed (but the coding challenge does not require it).Each month we provide a coding puzzle or exercise that is designed to be accessible to novices to Python, but that also provide additional challenges for more advanced users. We use the online platform at https://www.cyber-dojo.org/ to run the challenge and share our solutions with each other.For intermediate users, we will also be working on a small open source project for the PyATL organization, so you have the opportunity to learn on a \"real world\" project as well. The project is available at:The Jam session is also a safe space to work and ask for help on any Python project. Bring your own hobby projects, a work project, your new startup idea - whatever you like. Or come along and see others are working on, and sit down with them! The organizers will be there a bit early to help introduce people, organize, and make sure everyone is comfortable.

Programmers of all experience levels are welcome! We will be meeting from 7pm to 10pm to work together on a coding challenge or on any project you want. We recommend bringing a laptop with you, optionally with Python installed (but the coding challenge does not require it).Each month we provide a coding puzzle or exercise that is designed to be accessible to novices to Python, but that also provide additional challenges for more advanced users. We use the online platform at https://www.cyber-dojo.org/ to run the challenge and share our solutions with each other.For intermediate users, we will also be working on a small open source project for the PyATL organization, so you have the opportunity to learn on a \"real world\" project as well. The project is available at:The Jam session is also a safe space to work and ask for help on any Python project. Bring your own hobby projects, a work project, your new startup idea - whatever you like. Or come along and see others are working on, and sit down with them!
